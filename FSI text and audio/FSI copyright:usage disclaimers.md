## FSI copyright/usage disclaimers

- Audio and re-recordings: some sites or packages include new recordings made by private parties (not FSI staff). those re-recordings can be copyrighted by their creators — so don’t assume every MP3 you find is public-domain. (Some mirrors explicitly note when audio was re-recorded.)
- Third-party content inside FSI publications: FSI publications sometimes include copyrighted excerpts or materials provided by others. those portions are not public-domain automatically.
- Non-U.S. copyright: §105 is U.S. law. other countries may treat the work differently — if you’ll distribute internationally, check local rules or get legal advice.
Host/site extras and commercial packages: sellers or publishers who repackage FSI materials (Audio-Forum, etc.) may add copyrighted material or claim rights over their specific edition/packaging. verify provenance before relying on a commercial vendor’s claim.
