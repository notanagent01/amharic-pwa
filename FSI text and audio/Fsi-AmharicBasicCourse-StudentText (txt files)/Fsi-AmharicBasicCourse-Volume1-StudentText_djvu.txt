PREFACE 



This volume is the first of a two-volume Basic Course in Amharic, and contains 
Units 1-50 of the course. The second volume includes Units 51-60, an introduction to 
the writing system, a Reader, and a Glossary. 

Amharic, the official language of the Ethiopian Empire, is spoken natively by per- 
haps six million people in a small but populous area of the country which includes the 
capital, Addis Ababa. A member of the Southern Semitic branch of the Afro-Asiatic 
family of languages, Amharic is steadily gaining importance as it picks up additional 
speakers through the spread of communications and education within Ethiopia. 

The linguist in charge of the entire project has been Serge Obolensky, with the 
assistance of Mr. Debebow Selelie and Mr. Mulugeta Andualem. The Amharic script in 
the second volume is the work of Mr. Zelelie. Valuable suggestions received from Pro- 
fessor Wolf Leslau during the beginning stages of the work are gratefully acknowledged.

AMHARIC 



INTRODUCTION 



The Amharic Language 

Amharic is the official language of the Ethiopian Empire used m 
government, m business, m all instruction m government schools and m 
most newspapers. It is, however, not the only language spoken m Ethiopia. 
As can be seen from the map on page xv the area where Amharic is spoken 
as a native tongue is about one sixth of the whole territory of Ethiopia. 

Amharic belongs to the Southern Semitic branch of the Afro-Asiatic 
(formerly called Hamito-Semitic) family of languages. The number of native 
speakers of Amharic together with the speakers of the other Semitic languages 
spoken in Ethiopia (such as Tigrmiya, Tigre, Harari, Gurage and others) is 
less than one half the total population of the Empire. The greatest part of 
Ethiopia is inhabited by speakers of Cushitic languages (another branch of 
the Afro-Asiatic family) such as Galla, Agaw, Somali and many others. Since 
no census has ever been taken m Ethiopia the number of Ethiopians can only 
be estimated. According to the official data of the Ethiopian government 
the number of inhabitants of Ethiopia is between 20 and 22 million. It is 
also difficult to give a reliable estimate of the number of Amharic speakers; 
it is probably between 5 and 7 million. There is little doubt, however, that 
due to the constantly growing development of communications systems and the 
spreading of education Amharic is gaining ground throughout the whole country. 
It is now the language of greatest prestige and anyone who has had any educa- 
tion is able to speak it, even if it is not his mother tongue. Still others 
learn it informally as a second language.

Use of This Course 

1 . ' Basic Sentences ' , ' Structure Sentences 1 , ' Useful Words ' . 

The instructor reads the Amharic item by item, repeating each item (a 

build-up or a sentence) twice for each student. Each member of the class 

repeats the item immediately after the instructor trying to imitate his (or 
her) pronunciation. 

If m the instructor's opinion the item is mispronounced by the student, 
the instructor repeats it at normal speed with the student repeating after 
him (or her) as many times as necessary. After the class hours each student 
goes over the Basic Sentences by listening to the tape and repeating, doing 
this until he knows the dialogue by heart. 

After the Basic Sentences have been thoroughly memorized the students 
take part and act out the dialogues. The instructor may take one of the 
parts the first time or two. This drill is to be continued until any student 
can take part and go through the dialogue like an actor. 

2. Substitution , Correlation and Transformation Drills are to be used 

m accordance with the instructions given at the beginning of 
each drill. 

3. Model Transform Drills should be drilled m the same way as other 

Transformation Drills. 

i|. Questions and Answers . 

The questions and answers are to be drilled as specified below, but 
they should not be considered complete. Any question which is within the 
limits of the students' grammar and vocabulary can be asked. 

Some questions require informational answers some others simply 'yes ' 
or 'no ' answers . 



xvli 



AMHARIC 



Questions requiring informational answers are to be drilled as follows: 

The instructor asks each student a question. The student repeats the 
question and gives an answer. Any answer given by the student is considered 
correct if it is good Amharic. The answer is corrected by the instructor, 
if necessary. The student repeats the corrected answer. The instructor then 
gives the student the answer which is written in the book and the student 
repeats it as a further drill. 

Questions requiring 'yes 1 or 'no ' answers should be drilled m the same 
way, i.e. the student repeats the question after the instructor and gives him 
either an affirmative or a negative answer (or both if so requested by the 
instructor) . 

5. Narrative 

The instructor goes through the sentences (if any) illustrating new 
vocabulary items, m the same way as he did for Basic Sentences. After the 
students have thus familiarized themselves with the new words the instructor 
reads through the whole Narrative at a natural speed. The students listen 
for comprehension, books closed. The students summarise m English as much 
as they understood of the Narrative. The instructor reads each sentence 
again for each student, each of whom repeats after him. Each student trans- 
lates the sentence he repeated. This drill is continued until the students 
are thoroughly familiar with the material. The instructor then asks ques- 
tions listed at the end of each Narrative and the students answer them as 
completely as possible using words contained m the Narrative. In addition 
to the questions listed m the book the instructor may ask any question 
pertinent to the Narrative within the limits of the students ' grammar and 
vocabulary. The students memorize the Narrative by listening to the tape 
and relate the story to the instructor the next day. 

Students must keep m mind that there is no one correct way of speaking 
Amharic. Due to the poor system of communications in Ethiopia Amharic has 
developed various local dialects. There is an especially marked difference 
m pronunciation, in vocabulary, and even m grammar between the northern 
Gojjami and the southern Showa dialects. The purpose of this Course is to 
teach the language as it is spoken m the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa. 

Addis Ababa Amharic contains elements of a variety of dialects. The 

student should have this m mind and should always follow the manner of 

speech of his instructor even if his (or her) speech varies somewhat from 
what is indicated m this book.

UNIT 1 



Symbols Used in This Course 

On the English side , parentheses and quotation marks are used together 
('....') when a more literal translation is given m addition to the ordinary- 
English equivalent. 

Brackets [ 1 are used to indicate words m the English equivalent which 
do not have an equivalent in the Amharic. 

Parentheses ( ) indicate words which are m the Amharic but not m a 
normal English equivalent. The English side is not necessarily a literal 
translation but what is ordinarily said m this situation. The use of 
parentheses and brackets as explained above should make the situation clear 
m each case. 

On the Amharic side , parentheses are used to indicate sounds which are 
sometimes omitted. Brackets are used to indicate a more formal pronunciation 
to be used m more deliberate speech or while reading texts written m Amharic 
characters. Alternate pronunciations of the same word or alternate words are 
given after a slant lmei /. 

The accent mark used is / /. This indicates the loudest syllable m a 
word or phrase. Secondary stresses are not marked. 

As Amharic has an almost even distribution of stress on each syllable, 
it is sometimes extremely difficult to detect where the principal stress of 
a particular word lies. In this Course phrase stress will be marked m the 
Basic Sentences, but words in the buildups will be left unmarked unless the 
stress is clearly distinctive. 

An arrow / t / is used to indicate sharply rising pitch. 

A period / • / is used to indicate the end of a phrase accompanied by 
falling pitch. It may or may not correspond to an English period. 

A comma / > / indicates that the preceding tone is carried on evenly to 
the comma and that a new pitch contour begins following the comma. The 
syllables immediately before / , / are slightly lengthened. There may or 
may not be a break or pause after / > /. 

In the Notes slant lines are used to set off Amharic sounds or words 
within an English text. English letters and words are underlined when used 
as examples.

Grammatical Notes 

Note 1.1 Transcription Used m This Course 

This transcription is an attempt to put down systematically on 
paper the sounds that the instructor will say, or that will be heard on the 
tapes . 

The transcription is based directly on spoken Amharic and is not a 
tra nsliteration of ordinary Amharic spelling. It is not, strictly speaking, 
a 'phonetic' transcription. For example, the letter /b/ stands for one sound 
at the beginning of a phrase or if doubled, and for another sound elsewhere. 
Since the pronunciation is predictable on the basis of where it occurs, a 
single letter may be used for both sounds. 

The letters and other symbols used are:

AMHARIC 



Stress: Weak (unmarked) Strong 

Pitch: Indicated as contours m conjunction with phrase 

final juncture: Falling / / 

Rising / t / 

Change of Pitch / , / 

Juncture: Close: (no space) 

Open: Space between words 

Phrase final: / , / / t / / • / 

These letters should not be confused with those used for writing 
English or any other language. Every language has a unique sound system and 
symbols used to write a language must be defined m terms of that language. 
However, where the Amharic and English sounds are similar, the same letter 
is usually used m the transcription as is used m English. This does not 
mean that these sounds are identical. / 1 /, for example, is different m 
English and Amharic, even though the same symbol is used. 

The following notes are rough hints on the pronunciation of Amharic. 
English sounds are given for comparison, or more accurately for contrast, since 
they are different sounds. Only careful listening and practice can give the 
student the Amharic sounds. It is also very important to realize the possible 
diversity of sounds covered by a single symbol, the actual sound being deter- 
mined by the context. 

The Amharic writing system is syllabic: that is to say, each 
'letter' represents a consonant followed by a vowel. Since there are seven 
vowels m Amharic, it follows that there are seven different ways of writing 
a given consonant, depending on what vowel accompanies it. The writing system 
will be introduced at a later stage m the course. 

In the notes below, the vowel sounds are discussed m the order m 
which they come m the Amharic syllabary (but the letters are our transcrip- 
tion; they are not letters of the Amharic syllabary) .

UNIT 1 



AMHARIC 



In making /e/ the center of the 
tongue is raised almost to the 
roof of the mouth. 

Consonants immediately preceding 
this vowel may be slightly pala- 
talized, that is, the tongue is 
close to the position it takes 
for y_, so that the consonants 
have a slight % off-glide: by, 

V V etc> 

Technicallyi a higher-mid front 
unrounded vowel [e] 



/i/ may best be compared with a regular 
pronunciation of the u of 3ust m 
just a minute . 



Technically: a lower-high central 
unrounded vowel [il 

In initial position (at the beginning 
of an utterance) this vowel is voice- 
less and may be heard as a breathed 
glide to the following sound. 



birr

'dollar '

' name ' 



'please ' 
'there ' 
'here 1 



/of something like the £ of note but 
short, rounded from the beginning 
and without the w glide of English 
after the vowel. 

Consonants preceding /of are usually 
labialized, that is, are pronounced 
with rounded lips, resulting m a 
slight w off — glide t bw, pw ? i^w, etc. 



Technically: 



a mean-mid back 
unrounded vowel [Q] 



manor 

mgocca 

doro 



' to live ' 
'bread ' 
'chicken ' 



Vowels m Amharic are generally short. When final or followed by 
only one consonant they may be longer than when followed by two consonants, 
or by a long (double) consonant. 



6 



BASIC COURSE 



UNIT 1 



Note that after /w/ the following vowel, if normally unrounded, is 
initially rounded. This is particularly noticeable with /e/ and /i/. 

Examples : 

W8d9 'to wil 'agreement' 

wor 'month' wiha 'water' 

w©g9n 'sect' wisT 'inside 1 



Note 1.3 Consonants 

All consonants m Amharic occur short (indicated by a single symbolt 
r, 1, m, etc.) and long (indicated by doubling the symbol: rr, 11, mm, etc.). 

The distinction between short (single) and long (doubled) consonants 
is very important, as it may distinguish otherwise identical words, e.g. /als/ 
'he said', /alio/ 'there is'. 

Amharic has twenty- seven consonants which we write with the follow- 
ing symbols : , 

Plain: bcdfghjklmnnprs s twyz z 

Glottalized: C K P S T 



Note 1.3.1. 

Most of the plain consonants have near equivalents either in English 
or m other familiar languages such as French, Italian or Spanish. Hints on 
pronunciation are given as necessaryi 

/b/ has two pronunciations: at the beginning of a word, when 
doubled, or when immediately following /m/ or /n/ it is like English b m 
bet . Between vowels or finally the air is not completely stopped, so that 
a fricative sound results, rather than a stop. This is a bilabial spirant 
(or fricative), comparable to the b in Spanish Habana . Technicaly [(3l. 

Examples i 

bet 'house' monber 'pulpit' 

abbat 'father' aboba 'flower' 

wombor 'chair' gib 'goal' 

/c/ represents a sound like that of ch m church, 
/g/ like g m gun . 

/h/ has three pronunciations which sound somewhat different to a 
speaker of English: 

1) at the beginning or m the middle of the word it approximates 
the h to him. 



7 



UNIT 1 



AMHARIC 



2) at the end of the word it sounds almost like German ch m 
nach. Technically a velar spirant [xl. 

3) at the end of the word followed by the vowel /u/ this 
sound is like a sharp puff of breath with the lips 
rounded . 

Examples 1 

he do 'he went' hedhu 'I went' 

hedh 'you went' hedaccihu 'you (pi.) went' 

/l/ is formed farther forward m the mouth than English 1 and is 
very much like French 1 m elle or Italian 1 m 1 mgua . The middle of the 
tongue is closer to the roof of the mouth than it is for English 1. 

Examples 1 

ala 'he said' alio 'there is' 

/n/ is like ny_ sound m English canyon . Technically a palatalized 
n fnl or [ n y], 

/r/ is rolled or flapped - the tip of the tongue striking one or 
more times on the gum ridge behind the upper teeth. It is very much like 
Italian r m caro. 

Examples : 

neggero 'he told' roman 'pomegrenate ' 

borrsde 'it was cold' birr 'dollar' 

/s/ approximates the _sh sound m English harsh rather than m she . 
It is close to the French ch m chat . 

/t/ is made against the teeth rather than against the ridge back 
of the teeth as m English. It is otherwise very much like English t except 
m final position where it is more aspirated (released with a short puff of 
breath) . 

/z/ is like the French j_ m jour or somewhat like the English _s m 
m pleasure . 

/'/ is a glottal stop [*?], a stoppage of breath which can be heard 
before each of the words: m English if these words are pronounced slowly 
and deliberately. 

/y/ like j in yes , yeast , etc. Between vowels /y/ is just a kind 
of trough m between the vowel peaks. Both vowels are said distinctly, e.g. 
/keyst/ 'where from' /getaye/ 'sir', etc. 

/w/ like w m west . Between vowels /w/ is a slight w-glide, e.g. 
/baKlowoc/ 'mules'. Where the second vowel is an /o/, /w/ stands for the same 
kind of trough as described above m the case of /y/. The /w/ trough or glide 
is rounded. Compare the /w/ glide m /awo/ 'yes', /sowoc/ 'people' with the 
/y/ glide m /mayet/ 'to see' and /iyut/ 'look at it'. 



8 



BASIC COURSE 



UNIT 1 



The voiced consonants /b, d, g, z, z/ are generally devoiced m 
final position and sound very much like their voiceless counterparts /p, t, 
k, s, s/. They are, however, more 'lenis', i.e. pronounced with more relaxed 
muscles of the mouth. 

Note 1.3.2 

The glottalized consonant sounds /C K P S T/ are not like anything 
m English or any other language m Europe. These sounds are formed almost 
like /c k p s t/ as far as the tongue (or lips m case of /p/) are concerned. 
But they are 'exploded' not with air from the lungs but rather with the air 
imprisoned between the vocal cords (which are completely closed) and the 
tongue (or lips m case of /p/) .

UNIT 2 



AMHARIC 



In sentences 2 and 3 we have /hotelu/ and /Tabiyaw/, i.e. these 
nouns have the suffixes /-u/ and /-w/ respectively. 

The suffix /-u/ after consonants and /-w/ after vowels is added to 
masculine nouns or their modifiers (see later units) to make them definite 
or specific. It is generally used when the speaker refers to things or 
persons that have been mentioned before, or to things or persons which are 
m his presence. It is, however, not necessarily used m the same situations 
as the English definite article. The suffix makes the 'pointing out' or 
'reference ' more explicit. It is less used with plural nouns than with nouns 
m the singular. 

Note 2.2. 'and' /-d)nna/. 

The suffix /-mna/ after consonants and /-nna/ after vowels is the 
equivalent of the English word 'and', e.g. 

/hotelinna babur Tablya/ 'a hotel and a railroad station' 

/lzzlhinna lzziya/ 'here and there' 

It should be noted, however, that /mna/ may also occur as a sep- 
arate word. 

Note 2.3 Verb: The use of /now/ 'is' and /alls/ 'there is'. 

amerikan embassi yot new. Where is the American Embassy? 

babur Tabiyaw kezzih ruK now t Is the railroad station far from 

here? 

donna hotel ylt alio. Where is (there) a good hotel? 

The verb form /now/ 'is' (see Note 3.5-) denotes simple equation 
(x is y) . Its negative counterpart is /aydellom/ 'is not', e.g. 

/hulottmna hulott aratt now/ 'Two and two are ('is') four' 

/hotelu Tiru aydollom/ 'The hotel is not good ' 

The verb form /all©/ denotes the existence of something ( 'there 
is', 'there exists'). Its negative counterpart is /yollem/ 'there is not,' 
e.g. 

/and dehna hotel lzzih all©/ 'There is a good hotel here '. 

/lzzih^dohna hotel yellom/ 'There isn't a good hotel here. ' 

The word /ysllsm/ means also 'no ' .

Grammatical Notes 



Note 3.1 Pronoun: Independent Pronouns. 



me amerikawi non. 
anci Konjo nos. 
irsiwo. 

irsaccow tilliK naccow. 



I am an American. 

You (fern. sing.) are pretty. 

you (polite) 

He or she (polite) is big. 



These are examples of Independent Pronouns that have occured m the 
Basic or Structure Sentences. As one can see from the above sentences, there 
are two genders, masculine and feminine. Gender is distinguished only m the 
second and third person singular pronouns (familiar forms). All other pro- 
nouns are indeterminate of gender. 

As the personal ending (or other affix) of the verb indicates the 
person involved, the Independent Pronouns are much less used m Amharic than 
they are m English. When used, they are slightly emphatic. Attention is 
drawn to the fact that this particular person is, or these persons are doing 
so-and-so. 

The complete set of such pronouns is: 



ine 

ante 

anci 

irsiwo / issiwo 

irsu / issu 

irswa / isswa 

irsaccow / issaccew 

inna 

mnante 

mnossu / inner su 



you (masc. fam. ) 
you (f em. fam.) 
you (polite) 
he 
she 

he or she (polite) 
we 

you (pi.) 

they 



22 



BASIC COURSE 



UNIT 3 



As illustrated by the above list of the Independent Pronouns, 
Amhanc has different terms of reference with regard to people spoken to 
(second person) and people spoken of (third person). Thus /ante/ (addressing 
a man) and /anci/ (addressing a woman) show a certain degree of familiarity, 
/irsiwo/ is used as a polite or deferential form of 'you' (addressing both 
men and women), and /innanto/ addressing many persons without distinction of 
sex. /irsaccQw/ is a polite or deferential form of 'he' or 'she'. Note that 
verb forms used with the 'polite ' pronouns have the third person plural per- 
sonal endings. 

Note 3.2 Pronoun: Suffix Pronouns. 

1. yisTillin let him give for me. 

2. yisTon let him give us. 

3. sime jon new. My_ name is John. 



There are two kinds of suffixed pronouns t 

1) Verb Suffix (or Object) Pronouns, (Sentences 1 and 2) i.e. 
pronominal suffixes attached to verb stems or other forms of the verb. The 
translation of a Verb Suffix Pronoun depends upon the structure of English. 
For example the suffix /-on/ after consonants (/-n/ after vowels), can mean 
'me' (direct object) or 'to me' (indirect object) j /-accsw/ 'them' (direct 
object) or 'to them' (indirect object), etc. 

2) Noun Suffix Pronouns (Sentence 3) i.e. pronominal suffixes 
attached to nouns, corresponding to English 'possessive pronouns': 'my', 
'your', etc. These are discussed m Note l+.l. 

Note 3.2.1 The Verb Suffix Pronouns are: 



Singular 



After 
Consonants 

-8fl 

-lh 

-is 

-1WO /-lWOt 
-9W 



After 
Vowels 

-fi 

-h 

-s 

-wo /-wot 



-t 



(after /u/ and /c/) 
-at 



Meaning 
me, to me 

you, to you (masc.) 
you, to you (fern. ) 
you, to you (polite) 

him, to him /it, to it 



her, to her

Note 3.3 Loss of Vowels. 

As indicated m the chart of the Verb Suffix Pronouns (Note 3.2.1 
above) certain vowels are lost before the /-a-/ of the suffix pronouns /-at/, 
/-accihu/ and /-accow/. 

This loss of vowels occurs regularly m Amharic according to the 
following patterns t 



1) 9 + a = a 


e.g. 


2) a + a = a 


e.g. 


3) 1 + a = a 


e.g. 


if) 9 + 1 ■ 9 


e.g. 


5) 1+1=1 


e.g. 


6) a + 1 = a 


e.g. 


/w/ and /y/ glides 


before /- 



The Chart of Verb Suffix Pronouns (Note 3.2.1) indicates that /-u/ 
is /-uw-/, /-of is /-ow-/ and /-i/ is /-iy-/ before the suffix pronouns 
/-at/, /-accihu/ and /-accow/. 

These /w/ and /y/ glides occur regularly m Amharic before /-a-/ 
of the affixes, e.g. 



if the' last vowel of stem is /o/, /a/ or /1/ it is dropped and the 
suffix is added directly to the preceding consonant (see Note 3.3.) 
/u/ is /-uw-/, /of is /-ow-/ and /i/ is /-iy-/ before these suffix 
pronouns (see Note 3»i|.). 



2k 



BASIC COURSE 



UNIT 3 



u + a = uw + 



o + a - ow + 



i + a = iy + 



f olloguwaccow [folligu + accow] 
'they wanted them' 

folligowal [fglligo + all 
'he has wanted ' 

tifelligiyallos [tifelligi + alios] 
'you(f) want' 



Note 3.5 Verbi /no-/ 'be'. 

The verb stem /no-/ plus Verb Suffixed Pronouns (Note 3.2.1) con- 
stitute verb forms expressing simple equation* 'I am', 'you are', etc. 
These forms, illustrated m the Structure Sentences, may be either suffixed 
or separate words (e.g. /Tirunow/ or /Tiru new/ 'it's good'). They are 
themselves unstressed and the stress is regularly on the previous syllable, 
as m /tomariwoc non/ 'we are students'. 

The complete set of these forms is: 



Singular 



non 
neh 

nea ... ( . 4i .,^ 

nGwo/nowot

na t/ns c 



I am 

you (m. ) are 
you (f.) are 
you (pol.) are 
he is 
she is 



naccihu you are 

naccow they are 

(on he/she (pol.) is) 



Note 3.6. Formation of the Plural 

tsmariwoc non. We are students, 

astomariwoc naccihu- You are teachers. 

The general plural suffix m Amharic for both masculine and femi- 
nine is /-(w)oc/ (/-oc/ after consonants and /-woe/ after vowels.) With 
some speakers, words ending m vowels may drop the vowel and the suffix /-oc/ 
is affixed to the preceding consonant. Thus the Amharic word 'students' may 
be either /tomariwoc/ or /tomaroc/. Before vowels the plural suffix is usu- 
ally /-(w)occ/, as m /meSihaf occaccihu/ 'your books.' 

a to tosommanna a to lomma Mr. Tesemma and Mr. Lemma are 

ItyoPiyawiyan naccow. Ethiopians. 

The plural suffix /-yan/ is used exclusively with nouns denoting 
nationality ending in /-awi/ e.g. /ityoPiyawl/ 'Ethiopian' /ityoPiyawlyan/ 
'Ethiopians', /amerikawi/ 'American', /amer ikawlyan/ 'Americans', /mgllzawl/ 
'Englishman', /mglizawiyan/ 'Englishmen 1 , /foronsawi/ 'Frenchman', /ferensa- 
wlyan/ 'Frenchmen'. The use of the plural will be taken up m later units. 



UNIT 3 



AMHARIC 



Note 3.7 Transition vowel /1/ 

likk^ new. It's correct. 

Kirt^ hotel yet alio. Where is the near [est] hotel? 

The transition vowel, indicated above by / 1 / is a weak vowel glide 
that serves to interrupt a sequence or consonants across word boundaries. 

This vowel occurs at the point of word division whenever two words 
coming together produce a cluster of three consonants, or a cluster of two 
consonants, the first of which is an affricate: /c/, /j/, /C/. 

The transition vowel is not marked m our transcription because its 
presence is almost completely predictable.

/alls/ 'there is', 'there exists' (Note 2.3) and the plural /allu/ 
'there are', 'there exist' are used with Verb Suffix Pronouns. 

The thing possessed is the subject of /alio/ or /allu/. The owner 
is indicated by a suffix pronoun, e.g. /meSihaf alien/ 'I have a book', lit- 
erally 'there is a book to me', /ammist meSihafocc a Hun/ 'I have five books', 
literally 'there are to me five books'.

For the equivalents to 'have', 'have not' with feminine thing possessed 
see Note 5.1. 

Note I4..3 Feminine definite suffix /-wa ~ - (y ) itu ~ - (y) itwa/ 

The masculine definite suffix was discussed m Note 2.1. The fem- 
inine definite suffix is /-wa/; /-(y)itu/ (/-itu/ after consonants, /-yitu/ 
after vowels); or /-(y)ltwa/ (/- Itwa/af ter consonants, /-yitwa/ after vowels). 

All words indicating females are feminine. (Feminine gender will 
be discussed m detail m later units.) 



33 



UNIT k 



AMHARIC 



Examples : 

/tomariw/ 

/tomariwa/ or /tomariyitu/ 

or /tomariyitwa/ 
/astomariw/ 

/as temar iwa/ or /a s tomar iyitu/ 
or /astomariyitwa/ 

Nouns without definite suffix do not show gender. Thus the word 
/tomar i/, for example, may refer both to a boy and a girl student. The 
gender of 'indefinite' nouns is indicated by the verb endings, e.g. 



the (boy) student 
the (girl) student 

the (gentleman) teacher 
the (lady) teacher 



Tiru tomar i now. 
Tiru temari nec/nat. 



he is a good student, 
she is a good student. 



The most commonly used form of the feminine definite suffix is /-wa/. 



Note k'k Definite suffixes on modifiers. 

If a noun has a modifier the definite suffix is affixed to the 
modifier and not to the noun it modifies, e.g. /moSihafu/ 'the book', but 
/tinmsu moSihaf/ 'the small book'. 

Examples : 

dehnaw sow tmnis moSihaf allow. The good man has a small book, 

dehnawa set tmnis moSihaf allat. The good woman has a small book. 

Konjoyitu set and moSihaf allat. The pretty girl has a book. 

It should be noted that the definite suffix is affixed to the modifier 
even when the modified noun has a Noun Suffix ('Possessive') Pronoun, e.g. 

tinnisu moSihafih lzzlh alio. Your small book is here. 



Note Suffix /-(i)n/ specific direct object. 

Group 1 

meSihaf occaccihun kifetu. Open your books.' 

yihm Kal yidgemut. Repeat this word.' 

Group 2 

donna hotel liyasayyun yicilallu t Can you direct me to ('show 

me ' ) a good hotel? 
taksl iTerallohu. I '11 call a taxi, 

amariflna yawKallu t Do you know Amharic? 

In Group 1 the objects of the verbs (/moSihaf occaccihun/, /yihin Kal/) 
have a suffix /-n/ or /-m/. In Group 2 none of the objects have such a 
suffix. In Group 1 we have ' your books' (not just any book), ' this word' 
(a specific one). In Group 2 we have 'a good hotel' (any good hotel) 'a taxi' 
(not this particular taxi), 'Amharic ' (in general). 



3k 



BASIC COURSE 



UNITi| 



The suffix /-(i)n/ (/-m/ after consonants, /-n/ after vowels) 
must always be used: 

a) When the direct object is a specific noun, i.e. a noun with 

a definite suffix (/-u—w/ or /-wa — (y) Itu/) ; e.g. /moSihafu/ 
'the book', /moSihafun kifotu/ open the book'. 

b) When it is modified by a suffix pronoun, e.g. /moSihaf occaccihu/ 

'your books', /moSihaf occaccihun kifotu/ 'open your books'. 

c) When it is modified by a demonstrative pronoun, e.g. /yihin 
Kal yidgomut/ 'repeat this word'. 

d) When it is a proper name, an independent pronoun, a name of 
a country, or objects assumed to be commonly known, such as 
station, ministry etc. e.g. /glyon hotelin yasayyun/ 'show me 
the Glon Hotel', /kobbodon yawKallu/ 'they know Kebbede/ 
/irsiwon awKallohu/ 'I know you', /babur Tabiyan yasayyun/ 
'show me the railroad station'. 

When the direct object of the verb has a modifier, it is the 
modifier that usually takes the /-(i)n/ suffix and not the 
noun it modifies, as m /yihin Kal yidgomut/ 'repeat this 
word', /tmnisun meSihaf kifotu/ 'open the small book'. 

The suffix /-(i)n/ is not affixed to the indefinite, non- 
specific direct object (Group 2 above). 

Note I4..6 Prepositions. 

Amharic prepositions are usually inseparable from the word they 
precede. These 'prefix prepositions' lose their vowel when prefixed to words 
beginning with a vowel m accordance with the patterns listed m Note 3-3. 

If, however, the prepositions are said as separate words the vowel 
is not lost, e.g. 

/bamarinna/ or /b9 amarinna/ ' m Amharic'. 

Note I4-. 6. 1 Preposition /b(o)-/ 'to, by, in, at, on' and /bost(o)-/ 'to', 
' m the direction of'. 

botaksi mohod yicilallu. You can go by taxi, 

yih negor bamarinna mm yibbalal. How do you say this m Amharic? 

yamerikan embassl bostoKohniwo now. The American Embassy is on your right. 

The prefix preposition /b(oj-/ (/bo-/ before consonants, /b-/ 
before vowels) is used m equivalents to English prepositions 'to, by, m, at, 
on' and the prefix /bost(o)-/ (/bosto- before consonants and /bost-/ before 
vowels) m equivalent to English 'to' with reference to specific directions, 
such as 'to the right', 'to the left', 'to the north', 'to the south', etc. 

Other usages of the prefix /b(o-)/ will be taken up m later units.

In Amharic as m other Semitic lajiguages the verbs are listed m dic- 
tionaries m the 3rd person masculine singular Perfective form and not m 
the 'Infinitive' as m so many other languages. 

Thus the verb 'to want' is listed under /fellego/ 'he wanted', the verb 
'to see' under /ayys/ 'he saw', etc. 

The great majority of Amharic verbs have three basic consonants (tradi- 
tionally known as 'radical' or 'root' consonants) the second of which is 
almost always doubled. 

There are, however, a great number of verbs with two, four, or even 
five radicals. Some of the two-radical verbs, such as /ayy©/ 'he saw' /hede/ 
'he went', etc. are among the most common ones. 

The classification of Amharic verbs will be gradually introduced m the 
later units. 

Following is a list of various verb forms which have occurred m Units 
1 through 5 together with the corresponding Perfective form m the right hand 
column.

Note 5»2 Verbi Verb forms /alloc/ 'she exists', and /yolloccim/ 'she does 

not exist' as equivalents to English 'have' and 'have not' 
with feminine object (see also Note I+.2). 

Since the third person feminine of the verb /alio/ is /allocci-/ 
before Verb Suffix Pronouns (Note 5>.l), the equivalents of 'have' and 'have not' 
when what is possessed is feminine are as follows! (The construction is, lit- 
erally, 'something (feminine) is to me, to you, etc'.).

Note 5>»U Pronoun: Verb Suffix Pronouns used m apposition for emphasis. 

yihm Kal yidgemut Repeat this word ('it').' 

The Verb Suffix Pronouns are used not only to indicate the direct 
or indirect object of the verb (Note 3.2.1) as m /yidgomut/ 'repeat it', 
but can also be used with a verb which already has a noun as specific object, 
as m the sentence /yihin Kal yidg9mut/ above. The pronoun suffix is here m 
apposition to the preceding noun object, which must have a definite suffix. 
The use of this pronominal suffix on the verb is emphatic and may or may not 
be used by Amharic speakers, e.g. 'he saw the house' may be either /betun 
ayya/ or /betun ayy9w/. The suffix is not used if the object of the verb is 
indefinite, e.g. /bet ayye/ or /and bet ayyo/ 'he saw a house'. 

It should be noted that with the verbs which may have both direct 
and indirect objects — for example 'to give something (direct object), to 
somebody (indirect object)-the suffix pronoun is usuall y the indirect object , 
and not an emphasizer.

UNIT 5 AMHARIC 



Note 5.5.1 /k(e)-/ 'from' 

The prefix preposition /k(o)-/, (/ko-/ before consonants /k-/ 
before vowels), is equivalent to the English preposition 'from', when affixed 
to nouns, their modifiers or to the verbal nouns ('Infinitives'). Other 
meanings of /k(9)-/, as well as its use as a relational affix to verbs will 
be discussed in later units. 

In some Amharic dialects this prefix is /t(o)-/. The /t(o)-/ 
form appears m some compounds, such as /b9st(o)-/ (Note I4..6.I) = /be f isto/ 
for /be f lsko/j /tekkul/ (Note 8.1) = /te 4 lkkul/ for /ko 4- lkkul/, etc. 

Note 5.5.2 /isk(o)-/ 'up to', 'to' 

bosammmt kohulott lskassir 'It is from two to ten 

birr now. dollars a week. ' 

The prefix preposition /isk(o)-/ (/isk-/ before vowels, /isks-/ 
before consonants) corresponds m meaning to the English preposition 'to', 
'up to'. This preposition may be used either independently as m the above 
example or with the postposition /diros/ 'up to', e.g. 

ksbetu isko babur Tabiya 'He went from his house up to 

diros hedo. the railroad station. ' 

kozzih lskokotomaw diros 'It's very far from here to 

beTam ruK new. the city. ' 

Note 5.5.3 /1(e)-/ 'for', 'to' 

The prefix preposition /l(o)-/ (/lo-/ before consonants, /l-/ 
before vowels) corresponds m meaning to the English prepositions 'for' or 
'to' when affixed to nouns, their modifiers or verbal nouns ('Infinitives'). 
Other usages of this affix will be discussed m later units. 

Note 5.6 Postpositions! The postpositions /wisT/ 'm', 'inside' and /lay/ 
'on', 'upon' used m combination with the prefix prepositions 
/b(o)-/ or /l-/. 

bozzih hotel wisT bado 'Do you have an empty room 

kifl allowot t m this hotel? ' 

lfoKlay now. 'It's uspstairs. ' 

andennaw foKlay now. 'It's on the first floor. ' 

/wisT/ 'm', 'inside 1 and /lay/ 'on', 'upon' follow the word they govern. 
These postpositions may appear either m suffix forms, as in /lfoKlay/ or 
as separate words, as m /lfoK lay/. 

Both /wisT/ and /lay/ are used in combination with the prefix 
preposition /b(e)-/ (see Unit I4..6.I) or /1/ (zero before /a/ and /1/, see 
Note 3.3), e.g. /bobete wisT/ or /ibete wisT/ 'm my house'} /bandoMaw 
foKlay/ or /andonnaw foKlay/ 'on the first floor'. 



52 



BASIC COURSE 



UNIT 5 



Amhanc has a great number of such constructions, i.e. postposi- 
tions used m combination with certain prepositions. These constructions 
will be discussed m later units. 

Note 5*7 Nouni Suffixes /-iyye/ and /-iyyo/ 

sewiyyew abbatun meTrat 'The man wanted to call his 

fellege. father. ' 

setiyyowa nnatwan ayyoc. 'The woman saw her mother. ' 

The words /sew/ 'man, person' and /set/ 'female, woman' have 
alternative forms /sewiyye/ 'a man' and /setiyyo/ 'a woman'. Thus: /and 
sew meTTa/ or /and sewiyye meTTa/ both mean 'a man came'; /and set meTTa c/ 
or /and setiyyo meTTac/ 'a woman came'. When addressed directly to a person 
/sewiyye/ means something like 'hey you.'' and /setiyyo/ 'hey lady.'' 

The word /sew/ with the definite suffix is /sewiyyew/ and /set/ 
is /setiyyowa/. 

Note 5.7.1 Nouni Definite Suffixes /-lyyew/ and /iyyewa/. 

Parallel to the words /sew/ and /set/ the nouns of relationship 
have regular definite suffixes /-lyyew/ with the masculine nouns and /-iyyewa/ 
with the feminine nouns (with some speakers these suffixes ma'y be /-iyyow/ 
and /-lyyowa/). Examples: 



abbat 


'father ' 


abbatiyyew 


'the 


father ' 


innat 


'mother ' 


inna t iyyewa 


'the 


mother ' 


bal 


'husband ' 


baliyyew 


'the 


husband 


mist 


'wife ' 


mistiyyewa 


'the 


wife ' 


wendim 


'brother ' 


wendimmiyyew 


'the 


brother 


ihit/it 


' sister ' 


ihitiyyewa 


'the 


sister ' 


aggot 


'uncle ' 


aggotiyyew 


'the 


uncle ' 


akist 


'aunt ' 


akistiyyewa 


'the 


aunt ' 



These nouns may also have forms m /-iyye/ (see Note 5*7). They 
have a connotation of endearment or tender familiarity rather than that of 
mdef miteness, e.g. /wendimmiyye/ 'my dearest brother', /lhitiyye/ 'my 
dearest sister', 'sis', etc. 

The suffix /-iyye/ may sometimes be affixed even to adjectives, 
e.g. /Konjo/ 'pretty', /Konjiyye nat/ 'she is cute'. 

Note 5*8 Numerals: Ordinals 

andennaw foKlay new. 'It's on the first floor. ' 

The ordinals are formed from the cardinals by the addition of the 
suffix /-enna/ after consonants, /-nna/ after vowels. 

Examples! and 'one' andenna 'first' 

hulett 'two' hulettenna 'second'

Grammatical Notes 
Note 6.1 The Relational Prefix /y(e)-/ 

yamerlkan embassl, yet new. Where is the American Embassy? 

sime jon new, yersiwoss t My name's John, what's yours? 

yewiCC gudday ministr. The Minister of Foreign Affairs. 

The prefix /y(e)-/ indicates 'pertaining to' or 'possessed by'. It is 
affixed to the 'possessor' which always precedes the 'possessed' item, and is 
generally equivalent to English 'of or the apostrophe-plus- s possessive 
suffix, e.g. 

/yetemariw bet/ >the student's house' ('of the 

student [the] house') 
/yaddis abeba ketema/ 'the city of Addis Ababa' 

If the 'possessor' itself is modified, /y(e)-/ is prefixed to the 
modifier, e.g. 

/yeKonjo set bet/ »A house of a pretty girl'. 

/yeTiruw temari meSihaf/ 'The good student's book'.

UNIT 6 



AMHARIC 



If a noun has more than one modifier the relational affix /j{q)-/ is 
prefixed to the first one only, e.g. 

1ZZ ih yorajjimwa Konjo set 'Here is the book of the tall 

moSihaf alls. pretty girl.' 

If, however, the modifiers are separated by /-(i)nna/ 'and' or other 
conjunctions the relational affix is prefixed to both modifiers, e.g. 

/yoKonjowanna yastowayiwa tamari 'The father of the pretty and 

abbat moTTa./ intelligent girl student came.' 

The relational prefix /y(o)-/ is not used after prepositions and 
prefixes, and the possessive relationship is then indicated simply by the 
word order, e.g. 

/wods temariw bet hede/ 'He went to the student's house'. 

/babbate bet wisT/ 'In my father's house'. 

The prefix /y(o)-/ is affixed to all the independent pronouns (Note 
3.1) to form the 'possessive pronouns', e.g. /yone/ 'mine', /yanto/ 'yours 
(m.)' /yossu/ 'his', etc. 

Personal possession can, therefore, be expressed m Amharic in two 

ways: 

(1) (see Note k-k>) (2) 
moSihafe 'my book' yone moSihaf 

moSihafu 'his book' yossu msSihaf 

moSihafaccm 'our book' yenna msSihaf 

etc. etc. etc. 

The second construction is often used to show emphasis, or to make the 
meaning clear when the other form would be ambiguous, e.g. /meSihafu/ may 
mean 'his book' or 'the (particular) book', whereas /yossu moSihaf/ means 
'his book' ('of his the book') only. 

Note that 'American Embassy' can be said m Amharic in three ways: 
/yamerika embassi/ ('Embassy of America'), /amerikan embassi/, directly 
borrowed from English, and /yamerikan embassi/. 

Note 6.2 Verb: Infinitive 

kiflun mayot if olligallohu. I'd like to see the room, 

sowiyyew abba tun moTrat fellogo. The man wanted to call his father. 

The infinitive is characterized by the prefix /rnio)-/, e.g. /moTrat/ 
'to call', /mohed/ 'to go', /may9t/ 'to see', etc. (for the loss of the 
vowel /&/ see Note 3.3). 

The use of the Infinitive is often equivalent to that of English, as 
m /mayot if olligallohu/ 'I want to see'. When used as a verbal noun, it 
may have the prefixes and suffixes characteristically attached to nouns, as, 
for example m /komshedu bofit/ 'before his going' (prefix /ko-/, suffix 
/-V) •

Note 6.3 Verbx Imperf ec tive . 

The Structure Sentences of this unit show the use of the Imperfec- 
tive form, which is used with reference to present and future action. The 
Imperfective has a set of prefixes and the suffix /-all-/, with personal 
endings. It may be illustrated by the following example: 

The verb /mefellQg/ 'to want, to look for' 



Singular 

1st pers. if olligallohu 'I want' 

2nd pers.m. tif olligalloh 'you want' 

2nd pers.f. tif olligiyallss 'you want' 

3rd pers.m. yifelligal 'he wants' 

3rd pers.f. tif Glligallac 'she wants' 



Plural 
in(ni) folligallen 

tifolligallaccihu 



'you want ' 



yifolligallu 'they (or: polite 
you, he, she) 
want ' 



This verb has the following affixes: 
Singular 



Plural 



in(m) — all-9-n 
ti all accihu 



-all- 



-u 



1st pers. 1 all-o-hu 

2nd pers.m. ti all-9-h 

2nd pers.f. ti--iy — all-9-s 

3rd pers.m. yi al 

3rd pers.f. ti all-9c 

Except for the third person singular masculine suffix (/-al/) , 
these suffixes are identical with the verb /alia/ (see Note 5.1). 

The example above shows /ly/ before /-all-/ m the second person 
feminine singular. If the consonant preceding /-iy-/ (i.e. the last conso- 
nant of the stem) is one of the following eight consonants, it (and /-iy-/) 
are replaced as follows: 

/t-iy-/ by /c/, as m /tikof callos/ 'you (f . ) open' (masc. /t lkof talloh/) 

/d-iy-/ by /j/, as m /tihejalles/ 'you (f.) go' (masc. /tihedalloh/) 

/T-iy-/ and /S-iy-/ by /C/, as m /timoCallas/ 'you (f.) come' 

(masc. /timoTallgh/) 

/s-iy-/ by /s/, as m /tadarsallas/ 'you (f.) cause to arrive' 

(masc. /tadarsalloh/) 

/z-iy-/ by /z/, as m /tigazallas/ 'you (f.) buy' (masc. /tigazalloh/) 



61 



UNIT 6 



AMHARIC 



/n-iy-/ by /n/, as m /timm9S9gg9nall9s/ 'you (f.) are praised' 

(masc. /timm9S9gg9nall9h/) 

/l-iy-/ by /y/, as in /tiyallss/ 'you (f.) say' (masc. /tilallgh/) 

With some speakers only the consonant preceding /-iy-/ is replaced. 
The second person feminine singular is then: 

/t/ replaced by /c/ /tikgf ciyallgs/ 



/d/ " " /j/ /tihejiyallGs/ 

/T/ and /s/ " " /C/ /tuneCiyalles/ 

/s/ ' ' ' ' /s/ /tid9rslyall9s/ 

/z/ ' ' ' ' /z/ /tigeziyalles/ 

/n/ ' ' 11 /n/ /timm9S9gg9niyall9s/ 

/!/ " " /y/ /tiiyall9s/ 



Verbs m /a-/ lose the vowel /i/ of the prefixes (see Note 3*3) as m 
/awKallohu/ 'I know ' j /yadral/ 'he spends the night', etc. 

The verb /malot/ 'to say' is 'irregular'. lbs Imperf ec tive form is as 
follows : 

llallohu 'I say, am saying, will say' 

tilallGh 'you (m. ) say, etc' 

tiyallos 'you (f.) say, etc' 

yilal 'he says, etc. ' 

tilalloc 'she says, etc ' 

mnilallgn 'we say, etc. ' 

tilallaccihu 'you say, etc. ' 

yilallu 'they say, etc. '

Note 6.i| Verb: Classification. 

As mentioned m Note 5.1 a classification of Amharic verbs will be 
gradually introduced m xater units. The list of verbs m Note 6.3 above, 
makes it possible for us to introduce the two mam classes of verbs, i.e. the 
so-called regular three-radical verbs (types 'A' and 'B') and the regular 
two-radical verbs m /-a/ (types 'A' and 'B'). 

Note 6.1+.1 Three-Radical Verbs (types 'A' and 'B'). 

The regular three-radical verbs have the following distribution of 
vowels and root consonants ('radicals'): 



63 



UNIT 6 



AMHARIC 



In the Perfective both types have identical formula: 

1822q3 - where 1, 2 and 3 stand for the first, second and third 
radicals respectively. 

Examples : 

Type At noggoro 'he told' 

Type Bi f ollogo 'he wanted ' 

(The /-o/ is the ending for the third person singular.). 

In the Infinitive : 

Type A: mGl2o3 as m /mongor/ 'to tell', and 
Type B: m9l92293 as m /mofellog/ 'to want' 



In the Imperfective : 

Type A: -1823- as m /yi-nogr-al/ 'he is telling, he tells, 

he will tell ' , and 

Type Bt -1©22i3- as m /yi-f sllig-al/ 'he is wanting, he wants, 

he will want ' . 

This shows that the Imperfective form of type A and B verbs is always 
predictable from their Infinitive form. 

If the Infinitive is m9l293 (Type A) the Imperfective is -1923- 

Example: 

/m9ws9d/ 'to take' /y iwgsda l/ 'he takes' 

If the Infinitive is m9l922g3 (Type B) the Imperfective is -1922 i3- 

Examplet 

/m9f9ll9g/ 'to want' /yi fgllig al/ 'he wants' 

Note that the second radical of Type B verbs is always doubled.

In summary:

BASIC COURSE 



UNIT 6 



Note 6.^.2. Regular two-radical verbs m /-a/ (types 'A' and 'B'). 

The distribution of vowels and consonants ('radicals') of the 
regular two-radical verbs m /-a/ is: 

Infinitive Perfective Imperf ective 

Type A mol2at lo22a yi-le2-al 

mosrat sorra yi-sor-al 

Type B m8lo22at la22a yi-lo22-al 

moToTTat ToTTa yi-T9TT-al 

Note that the Infinitive of the regular two-radical verbs m 
/-a/ ends m /-at/. 

Note also that the second radical of Type B verbs is always 

doubled. 

Note 6.5 Verb: Notation. 

Beginning with Unit 7 the three basic forms (i.e. Infinitive, 
Perfective and Imperf ective) of all verbs occurmg for the first time m 
the Basic or Structure Sentences or m the Narratives will be given m the 
build-ups as follows: 

'to take ' W9ss9d9-m9ws9d-yiw9sdal 

'to go' hed9-m9hed-yihedal, etc. 

After the student has thoroughly familiarized himself with all 
'regular' verbs (i.e. three-, two-, four-radical verbs and other 'predictable' 
verbs), the infinitive forms only will be given in the build-ups while the 
three basic forms will continue to be given for the 'irregular' verbs only. 



Note 6.6. Postpositions: 

The postposition /gar ~gara/ 'with' combined with the prefix 
preposition /k(o)-/. 

K9T9row koman gar new. 'With whom is the appointment?' 

kowiCG gudday mlnistru gar ngw. 'It's with the Minister of Foreign 

Affairs. ' 

The postposition /gar/ (/gara/ m some dialects) is used m com- 
bination with the prefix preposition /k(g)-/. The resulting construction 
corresponds m meaning to English 'with' (together with, accompanied by). 
In spoken Amharic /gar/ usually appears m the form of a suffix /-gar/, e.g. 
/kok9bb9d9gar/ 'with Kebbede, ' /kgnegar/, 'with me, ' /karsugar/ 'with him, ' 
etc. 



65 



UNIT 6 



AMHARIC 



Note 6.7. 

The use of /k( g )-... bgfit/ 'before' and /k( 9 ) - . . . bghwala/ 'after.' 

kgmghedu befit bunna yiTeTTal. 'He'll have [a cup of] coffee 

before he leaves. ' 

kgzziya behwala mm tisgrallgh. 'What are you going to do after 

that?' 

The prefix preposition /k(9)-/ is prefixed to words followed by 
/bgfit/ 'before' and /bghwala/ 'after', e.g. /kand sgat bgfit/ 'an hour ago' 
'before one hour'), /kstmant bgfit/ 'the day before yesterday'; /kghulgtt 
seat bghwala/ 'm two hours' ('after two hours'), /kgnggg bohwala/ 'the day 
after tomorrow ' . 

Note that /kosgat bgfit/ means 'before noon' and /kgsgat bghwala/ 
'm the afternoon'. 

When used with verbs, i.e. m the subordinate clauses corresponding 
to English 'before doing so-and-so', or 'after doing so-and-so,' the Amharic 
constructions are as follows: r - 

/k(g)- .. .bgfit/ is used with the infinitive, the subject of the 
verb (from the English point of view) being indicated by the noun suffix 
pronoun affixed to the infinitive, as m /kgmghedu bgfit/ 'before his going', 
and /k(g)-... bghwala/ with the Perfective, e.g. /kehede bghwala/ 'after he 
went' or 'after he goes'. Either construction may be used m the subordinate 
clause. The time reference is specified by the tense of the verb used m the 
mam clause. 

Examples: 

komehede bgfit bunna lTgTTallghu. 'I '11 have a cup of coffee before 

I leave ' . 

kgmehede bgfit bunna TgTTahu. 'I had a cup of coffee before I 

left . ' 

kehedhu bghwala bunna tiTeTTalgh. 'You'll have a cup of coffee after 

I leave . ' 

kohedhu bghwala bunna TgTTah. 'You had a cup of coffee after I 

left . '

Note that the /-i/ (/-iy-/ before /a/) for second person feminine 
singular, and the /-u/ for second and third person plural are regularly 
added to the stem before the pronoun object suffix. 

Note also that the imperfective suffix /-al/ is the same for singular 
and plural m the third person, the plural being shown by the /-u/ before 
the pronoun suffix, as m /yif olligonal/ 'he wants me ' and /yif Qlligunal/ 
'they want me ' . 



Note 7.2 Verb: Amharic equivalents of 'I had, you had' etc. --the Perfective 
forms /nsbboro/, /nobboroc/ 'it was' and /nebbaru/ 'they were' plus 
verb suffix pronouns. 

The Amharic equivalent of 'I had (something), you had (something) ' etc., 
is, literally, '(something) was to me, to you' etc. The something that is 
possessed is the subject of the perfective form /nobboro/ if it is masculine, 
/n9bb9r9c(ci)-/ if it is feminine, or /n9bberu/ if it is plural. The owner 
is expressed by a verb suffix pronoun (see Note 5.2).

yiyizmna, kaleloc tomariwoc gar books and goes to school with 

wade timihirtbet yihedal. the other students. 

vJhen two verbs m the imperfective follow each other and the first verb 
has the suffix /-(i)nna/ 'and', the imperfective suffix /-all-/ is affixed to 
the second verb only. 



Note 9.2 Verb: Negative perfective. 

As shown by the Structure Sentences the Negative of the Perfective is 
formed by affixing the prefix /al-/ and the suffix /-(i)m/ (/-im/ after con- 
sonants and /-m/ after vowels) to the Affirmative verb forms. It may be 
illustrated by the following examples:

Note that before /r/ the negative prefix /al-/ is replaced by /ar-/. 
If the verb has a verb suffix (object) pronoun, the latter is affixed to it 
before the negative suffix /-(i)m/, e.g.

Note 9.3 Verbt Short Imperfective. 

As illustrated by the Structure Sentences the Negative of the 
Imperfective is formed by affixing certain prefixes and the Suffix /-(i)m/ 
to a verb form which will be hereafter referred to as the ' Short Imperfective . 1 

In most cases the Short Imperfect has the same distribution of con- 
sonants and vowels as the Imperfective, but does not have the suffix /-all-/. 

Besides the Negative form of the Imperfective, the Short Imperfec- 
tive is used m subordinate clauses with various relational affixes as well 
as with the postverb /zond/ 'so that'. This will be discussed m later units. 

The Short Imperfective without the relational affixes is a stem 
form which is not used by itself. This stem form has the following prefixes 
and suffixes: 



Singular 

1st per. (1)- 

2nd per. m. td)- 

2nd per. f. t(i)- 

3rd per. m. y(i)- 

3rd per. f. t(i)- 



Plural 
mn(i)-... in- 



td)- 

yd)- 



The /1/ of these prefixes is lost before the stems m /a-/. 



93 



UNIT 9 



AMHARIC 



There is. an alternation of vowel pattern m the short imperfective steins 
of certain verbs, e.g. /ymogir/ with /-negir/, but /ymogru/ with /-nogr-/. 
The form with /i/ occurs when final, the one without /i/ occurs when a vowel 
follows. Some speakers, however, have the form without /i/ only, even in 
final position (e.g. /ymogr/) . 

(in the regular imperfective , only the form without /i/ occurs, because 
the regular imperfective always has a suffix beginning with a vowel (/-al/ 
etc.), as in /mograllohu/. ) 

The vowel alternation m the short imperfective stems occurs with regular 
three-radical verbs of type A and with /a-/ verbs of type A (to be discussed 
m later units). The following chart illustrates these as well as the three- 
radical verb of type B which does not have any alternation form:

Note that the first person plural prefix may be either /mm-/ or /m-/ 
before consonant stems, e.g. /mfellig/ or /mmfollig/, /mnsgir/ or 
/mnmogir/. 

If the last consonant before the suffix /-i/ of the second person femi- 
nine singular is one of the eight consonants listed m Note 6.3, it and /i/ 
are replaced by the corresponding consonant as shown m that note, i.e.: 

/t/ is replaced by /c/ 

/d/ is replaced by / j/ 
/T/ and /S/ are replaced by /c/ 

/s/ is replaced by /s/ 

/z/ is replaced by /z/ 

/n/ is replaced by /n/ 

/l/ is replaced by /y/ 



9^ 



BASIC COURSE 



UNIT 9 



After the relational affixes (which will be discussed m detail m later 
units) the following variants of the short imperfective prefixes occur t 

(1) The short imperf ective prefix /yi-/ is replaced by the vowel /i/, 

e.g. 

bifallig 'if he wants' (Short imperf ective ) /yifollig/ 

binogru 'if they tell' (Short imperf ective ) /ymogru/ 

(2) The short imperfective prefix /t(i)-/ becomes /-tt(i)-/ when affixed 
to /a-/ stems (/a-/ verbs m the Perfective) or to double consonant 
stems (/t(o)-/ verbs m the Perfective), e.g. 

bittadir 'if you spend the (Short imperfective) /tadir/ 

night' (Perfective) /addere/ 'he spent 

the night ' 

bittiffellog 'if you are wanted' (Short imperfective) /tiffellog/ 

(Perfective) /tofollogo/ 'he is 
wanted ' 

(3) The same prefix /td)-/ becomes either /-tti-/ or /-t-/ before other 
consonant stems, e.g. /bittif ellig/ or /bitfellig/ 'if you (m) want' 
or 'if she wants'; /bittmogir/ or /bitnogir/ t/bitn8gr/ with some 
speakers) ' 'if you (m) tell' or 'if she tells'; /bittihedu/ or 
/bithedu/ 'if you (pi.) go'; etc. 

The choice of /-tn-/ or /-t-/ is optional. 

Note 9*h- Verbt Negative Imperfective. 

As mentioned m Note 9-3 above, the negative imperfective is formed 
by affixing certain prefixes and the suffix /-(i)m/ (/-im/ after consonants 
and /-m/ after vowels) to the short imperfective stem. This may be illus- 
trated by the following examples:

The above examples show that: (l) The second person masculine and the 
third person feminine singular forms are identical. (2) Stems beginning m 
/r-/ have the prefix /ar-/ substituted for /al-/ m the first person singular. 
(3) Stems ending in a vowel lose this vowel m the 2nd person feminine singu- 
lar and m the 2nd and 3rd person plural. The vowel is replaced by /i/ m 
the 2nd person feminine singular and by /u/ m the 2nd and 3rd person plural. 
(1+) The eight consonants /t/, /d/, /T/, /s/, /s/, /z/, /n/, /l/ are replaced 
by the corresponding palatal consonants before /i/ of the second person femi- 
nine singular as indicated m Note 9.3. 

Bearing this m mind, the negative affixes of the imperfective can be 
summed up as follows:

As m the Affirmative (see Note 2.3) the verb 'be' has two forms m the 
Negative: one to indicate equation, the second to indicate presence or exist- 
ence. The negative forms are 'irregular' (i.e. not predictable from the Af- 
firmative) .

Grammatical Notes 

Note 10.1 Relational Affixes to Verbs 

Amharic has a great number of affixes which are prefixed to verb 
forms to constitute constructions corresponding m meaning approximately to 
subordinate clauses m English. 



Note 10.1.1 Relational Affix /yU)-/ ~ /yemmd)-/ m Relative Constructions. 

betimihirtbetu wisT yommiggonnut [All] the students who are (found) 

tsmariwoc amerikawiyan bicca in this school are (only) 

naccow. Americans. 

In Unit 6, the Relational affix /y(e)-/ 'pertaining to' was discussed 
as a noun and adjective prefix (Note 6.1). 

The same prefix /y(o)-/ (/y-/ before /a/ and /ye>-/ elsewhere) can be 
prefixed to Perfective forms of verbs. The resulting constructions corre- 
spond to English relative clauses ('which', 'that', 'who' clauses), e.g. 

/yefolloghu/ 'pertaining to my having wanted' 

Similar constructions containing Short Imperfective verb-forms are made 
with the prefix /yommd)-/ (/yomm-/ before vowels, /yomml-/ before /ya/, and 
/yommi-/ elsewhere). (See Note 9.3 for the replacement of /yi-/ of the Short 
Imperfective by the vowel /l/.) e.g. 

/ysmmif ellig/ 'pertaining to my wanting' 



10? 



UNIT 10 



AMHARIC 



Examples : 



yomoTTa 
yomGTTac 

yommimoTu 
ysmmitsoC 



' (he) who came ' 
' ( she ) who came ' 
'(they) who are coming' 
'(you-f.) who are giving' 



With transitive verbs these affixes may refer either to the actor of 
the verb or to its object, e.g. 



yof olloghu 



yoserrac 



yommisora 



yommitfolligu 



' (I) who wanted ' 
'(that) which I wanted' 

' ( she ) who ma de 

'(that) which she made' 

• (he) who makes ' 
'(that) which he makes' 

'(you-pl.) who want' 

'(that) which you (pi.) want' 



When used as a modifier the relative construction agrees m gender and 
number with the noun it modifies, e.g. 



yommimoTa sow 
yomoTTac set 
yemoTTu sowoc 



'a person who is coming' 
'a woman who came ' 
'people who came » 



If the modified noun is definite, the definite suffix is affixed to 
the relative construction (e.g. /yommihedow tomari/ 'the student who is 
leaving) . 

With masculine nouns the definite suffix is /-ow/ after consonants, 
/-t/ after /u/, and /-w/ elsewhere. 

With feminine nouns the definite suffix may be either (l) the feminine 
definite suffix /-wa/ (in some areas /-(y)itwa/ or /-(y)itu), or (2) the 
masculine definite suffix. Examples* 



yohedow sowiyye. 

yomoTTut sowoc. 

yommimeTaw sowiyye. 

yomeTTacciwa 

(or t yomeTTacciw) setiyyo. 



'the man who went' 
' the men who came ' 
'the man who is coming' 
' the woman who came ' 



108 



BASIC COURSE 



UNIT 10 



yemmitmoTawa 'the women who is coming' 

(or t yammitmoTaw) setiyyo 

yemsTTut setoc 'the women who came' 

The relative construction may have an object. If the object is definite 
or ispecific, the object suffix /-(i)n/ is affixed to it. 

The corresponding verb suffix pronoun, (used m apposition, see Note %.h) 
may or may not be affixed to the relative construction. 

Examples : 

moSihafun yafallsghut 'I am [the one] who wanted 

(or: yafollaghu) me nsrl. the book. ' 

yommitf alligewm mokina 'I saw the car that you(m) 

ayyohut (or: ayyohu) . were looking for. 

yagezzasiwm msSihaf ayyehut 'I saw the book that you(f) 

(or: ayyohu) . bought. 

yommittiTariyatm setiyyo 'I saw the lady you(f) are 

ayyshuwat (or: ayyehu) . going to invite. 

If the object is indefinite, the verb suffix pronoun is not commonly 
used, e.g. 

and meSihaf yafslloghu I am [the one] who wanted 

me non. a book. 

and bet yessrrac irswa nat. She is [the one] who built 

a house. 

The relative construction may itself function as the object of some 
other verb. In such instances, since the relative construction is always a 

definite object, the object suffix /-(i)n/ is affixed to it, and the appro- 
priate verb suffix pronoun may or may not be affixed to the principal verb. 

Examples : 

ysfollogswin agannew 'he found what he wanted. ' 

(or: agsnns). 

izzih yallQwm if olligowallahu 'I want [the thing] which 
(or t lfolligallohu), is here. ' 

In negative relative constructions the negative suffix /-(i)m/ is 
omitted, e.g. 

yommalfGlligGW moSihaf. 'the book I don't want. 1 

yalfolloghut moSihaf. 'the book I didn't want. ' 



109 



UNIT 10 



AMHARIC 



If other affixes are prefixed to the relative constructions, the affix 
/y(e)-/ with the perfective, and the /ye/ part of the affix /yemmd)-/ with 
the imperfective, are omitted, e.g.i 

leTerrahut sow neggerhut. 'I told it to the person I invited.' 

(/yeTarrahut sow/ 'the person whom I invited') 

lemmiTeraw sow megrewallehu. 'I '11 tell it to the person I 'm 

going to invite ' 
(/yemmiTeraw sow/ 'the person whom I'm going to invite'). 

If the objeot m the relative clause is itself modified, the relative 
construction may have three different variants, e.g.: 



Perfective 

/tilliKun bet ayyohut/ 
'I saw the big house ' 



Relative Construction 

1) /tilliKun bet yayyehut me neh/ 

'It is I who saw the big house ' 

2) /yayyehut bet tilliK now/ 

'The house I saw is big'. 

3) /yayyehut tilliKun bet new/ 

'What I saw is the big house'. 



Imperfective 

/tilliKun bet ayewallehu/ 
'I see the big house ' 



1) /tilliKun bet yemmayew me nen/ 

'It is 1 who see the big house. 

2) /yemmayew bet tilliK new/ 

'The house I see is big'. 

3) /yemmayew tilliKun bet new/ 

'What 1 see is the big house ' . 



Note 10.2 The use of the affix /md(e)-/ 'like (as) ', 'such as 
as', 'as', 'that', 'according to'. 



mdeleloc temariwoc yamarinna 
gazeTa anebballehu. 

mdagennewo neggeren. 



I read Amharic newspapers like the 
rest of the students. 

He told me that he [had] met you. 



Note 10.2.1 /md(e)/ 'like', 'm the same manner as', 'm the same way as', 
'according to ' . ' 

The affix /md(e)-/ (/md-/ before vowels, /mde-/ elsewhere) prefixed 
to nouns or their modifiers means 'like', 'm the same manner as', or 'accord- 
ing to ', e.g» 



110 



BASIC COURSE 



UNIT 10 



mdone yimmaral. 

mdoleloc temariwoc is9rall8hu. 

mdersiwo nigiggir. 



'He studies like me'. 

f I work like other students'. 

'according to your speech'. 



Note 10.2.2 /ind(o) yalle/ 'like', 'such as' 

/ind(o)-/ m combination with the relative phrase /yalle/ 'that he (it) 
exists' (/yallu/, /yallec/, etc. according to person and number) may be used 
to modify nouns, e.g.: 



mdabbatu yalle sow ayiggonnim. 



'There is no person like his 
father ' . 



mdemeShafoc yallu nogoroc gezzahu. 'I bought things like books', 
mdohitu yalloc set ayyo. 'He saw a woman like his sister'. 



Note 10.2.3 /md(e)-/ 'as soon as', 'as'. 

/md(e)-/ can also be prefixed to perfective forms of verbs to produce 
'as soon as' or 'as' clauses. It should be noted that a Perfective form 
describes the completion of an action (whether past or future). The /ind(a)-/ 
constructions, therefore, indicate a future action if the verb of the main 
clause is an Imperfective form and a past action if the verb of the main 
clause is a Perfective form e.g.: 

mdeneggerheri bete lhedallehu. 'I '11 go home as soon as (or: the 

way) you tell me ' . 

mdeneggerhen bete hedku. 'I went home as soon as (or: the 

way) you told me ' . 

Note 10.2.1).. /md(e)-/ with Relative Constructions: 'that' 

/md(o)-/ is prefixed to Relative Constructions (Note 10. l) to produce 
subordinate clauses m connection with verbs meaning 'say', 'tell', 'know', 
etc . 

Examples : 

wsdobet mdohedo noggeren. 
wodobet lndemmimeTa awKallehu. 
lijun mdayyew noggeren. 
tomariw Tiru mdemmihon yawKallu. 



'He told me that he went home'. 

'I know that he'll come home'. 

'He told me that he saw the child'-, 

'They know that the student will 
be good'. 



Ill 



UNIT 10

mdehonec noggoron. 

mdayyehen yawKal. 



'He told me that Miss Almaz 
m the hospital ' . 

•He knows that you saw me'. 



If the verb m such an /md(©)-/ construction has an object which is 
definite, the verb suffix (object) pronoun (used m apposition — Note £.1+) 
may or may not be affixed to it. If there is an indefinite object, the 
suffix pronoun is not affixed. 



Examples : 



yihm bet mdogozzacciw 

(or: mdogozzac) awKallahu. 



but: 



and bet mdogozzac awKallohu. 

mokinawan lndoseTocciw 

(or: mdosoToc) noggorsin. 



'I know that she bought this 
house ' . 



'I know that she bought a house'. 

'You (f.) told me that she [had] 
sold the car. ' 



mokina mdssoToc noggorsin. 

gazeTawm lndalanobbebecciw 

(or: mdalansbbebsc) nsggorkuh. 



but i 



'You (f.) told me that she [had] 

sold a car. 1 
'I told you that she hadn't read 

the paper ' . 



gazeTa mdalansbbobac nGggorkuh. 'I told you that she hadn't read 

a paper ' . 

Sometimes the meaning of the /md(o)-/ clause may be ambiguous. Thus 
for example /mdomoTTa neggoron/ may mean both 'he told me that he came ' and 
•he told me as soon as he came'. 



Transformation Drill 

Drill 1 

The instructor will say sentence A. The student will repeat the sen- 
tence. The instructor will then say the underlined word listed to the right 
of sentence A. The student will repeat the sentence changing it into 'indi- 
rect speech' (sentence B) . 

Drill 2 

The instructor will say sentence B. The student will repeat it and 
then say it again changing the verb form into negative (sentence C).

I feel better since the doctor came 
( 'having come ' ) and gave me some 
medicine . 

Recently I met ( 'having met') your 
daughter, Miss Almaz, on the street 
[and] she told me how you were. 

Almaz, being sick, is now m the 
hospital . 



The underlined words m the sentences above represent the form of the 
verb known traditionally as the 'Gerund'. This form is tenseless and usually 
carries the sense of 'having done so-and-so', or 'on doing so-and-so'. 

The Gerund m Amharic is inflected for person, gender, and number. Its 
subject may be different from the subject of the mam verb (as m the second 
sentence above ) .

Except for the first person singular, the Gerund stem of three- and 
two- radical verbs, types A and B, is the same as that of the Short Imper- 
fective . 

Verbs which have an additional /-t/ in the infinitive have a gerund 
stem m /-t/ (type A) and m /-it/ (type B) . The /-a/ of the two-radical 
regular verbs m /-a/ is lost before /-t/ and /-it/. 

The personal endings of the Gerund are:

In the first person singular the last consonant is doubled and Type A 
verbs have an /i/ before the doubled consonant. If the last consonant (i.e. 
the consonant before the first person singular ending) is one of the eight 
dental or alveolar consonants listed m Note 9.3, the latter is replaced by 
the corresponding palatal consonant. 

The Negative Gerund is formed m the same way as the Negative Perfective , 
i.e. by affixing the prefix /al-/ and the suffix /-(i)m/, e.g. 



/alnogrom/ 
/alf olligom/ 
/algobtom/ 



'he not having told' 
'he not having wanted' 
'he not having entered ' 



The Negative G-erund is very rarely used.

UNIT 11 



AMHARIC 



The Verb /ale, ma 1st, yilal/ 'to say' has an irregular gerund, i.e.: 



biyye 


'I, saying / having said' 


bil9h 


'you (m) , saying / having said' 


bilss 


'you (f), saying / having said' 


bilo 


'he, saying / having said'

'she, saying / having said' 


bilon 


'we, saying / having said' 


bilaccihu 


'you (pi), saying / having said' 


bllQW 


'they (he, she, you - pol), saying / having 



In direct quotations the gerund of the verb /ale/ comes after the words 
which are spoken and is followed by the mam verb, e.g.: 

almoTam bilo noggoron. 'He told me (' saying ')» 'I 'm not coming', 

lhedallohu bila neggoroccm. 'She told us ('saymg')t 'I'm going'.

Verbs having one of the eight palatal consonants indicated m Note 9.3 
may lose the final /-ey-/ of the first person singular before suffixes m

may be:

'I having met her 1 

'I having caused you (pi.)

Note 11.3 Verb: Present Perfect 

k9t9yayy9n bizu 
gize hononal. 



'It has been a long time 
since we saw each other. 



The Present Perfect is formed by adding the suffix /-al(l)-/ to the 
gerund. In all the persons of the Present Perfect, except the first and 
third person feminine singular, this suffix is /-al/. The first person 
singular has /-allohu/, the third person feminine singular /-allgc/.

f glligghal 
f 9llig9sal 
f glligowal 

f 9lllgall9C

BASIC COURSE 



UNIT 11 



The Verb Suffix Pronouns (Object pronouns) occur before the suffix 
/-al(l)-/ (as m the imperfect lve ) , e.g. /kobbodon aytohowal t/ 'have you 
seen Kebbede? ' 

The Present Perfect m Amharic is virtually interchangeable with the 
Perfective; there is no significant difference m meaning, e.g. /hedo/ 'he 
went' or 'he has gone', as well as /hedowal/ 'he went' or 'he has gone'. 

The Negative form of the Present Perfect is not used, (except m some 
areas) the Negative Perfective is used instead. 

Note 11.1; Verb: Past Perfect 

wodaddls kotoma lomohed folligge 'I (had) wanted to go to Addis 
nabbormna, awtobusun yot Ketema and I don't know where 

lndGmmaggonnow alawKim. to find the bus. ' 

The Past Perfect m Amharic is a verb phrase, consisting of a Gerund 
(inflected for person, gender, and number—Note 11.3) and an unmflected 
auxiliary /nobber/ or /nabbere/, e.g. /nogirre nobbor/ 'I had told', /nagraw 
nabbar/ 'they had told', etc.* '(Note that the auxiliary m the English equiv- 
alent is had , while the Amharic auxiliary is /nobber/ or /nabbara/ 'was'.) 

Following is the paradigm of the verb /fallaga/ m the Past Perfect: 

felligge nabbar 'I had wanted' 

falligah nabbar 'you (m) had wanted' 

falligas nabbar 'you (f) had wanted' 

folligo nabbar 'he had wanted' 

falliga nobbor 'she had wanted' 

folligon nobbor 'we had wanted' 

folligaccihu nobbor 'you (pi.) had wanted' 

folligow nobbor 'they (he, she, you) had wanted 

The Past Perfect is used m Amharic: 

1) to describe a past action or state which was supposed to take place, 
but did not occur (often with 'but', 'however', 'because'), e.g. 
/momTat folligge nobbor, gin bird now/ 'I was going ('had wanted') 
to come, but it's [too] cold 1 . 



However, some speakers of Amharic use /nogirre nobborhu/, /nogroh 
nobberh/ etc., but this form is much less common than that with the 
unmflected form /nobbor/. This is also applicable to Note 11.5. 



127 



UNIT 11 



AMHARIC 



2) 



3) 



to describe a past action or state preceding another action or state 
m the past, e.g. /kebbede bemeTTa glze, lemma hedo nebber/ 'when 
Kebbede came, Lemma had [already] left. ' 

to describe an action that took place m the absence of the person 
spoken to, e . g. /baratt seat irsiwon lemayet meTicce nebber, negergm 
alnebberum/ 'I came ('had come') to see you at four o'clock but you 
were not there. ' 



to describe an action which occured m the distant past, e.g. 
/kassir amet boflt addis abeba wisT agniccewo nebber/ 'I (had) met 
you in Addis Ababa ten years ago. ' 

The Negative Past Perfect is formed by adding /nebber/ to the Negative 
Perfective form of the verb, e.g. /alhedhum nebber/ 'I had not gone', 
/alfellegem nebber/ 'he had not wanted', etc. 



Note 11.5 Verbi Imperfect (Past) 

tolo lemewTat lfellig nebber. 'I'd like ('I was wanting') to 

leave soon'. 

The Imperfect is formed by adding /nebber (e)/ to the Shorty Imperfective 
form of the verb. It denotes a continuous or habitual action or state m 
the past and corresponds roughly to the Continuous Past or Past Progressive 
m English ('was doing so-and-so', or 'used to do so-and-so'). It is also 
used to refer to an action which could have but did not take place, as m 
/tmant lmeTa nebber, negergm alcalhum/ 'I would have come yesterday, but 
1 couldn't'. (its use m conditional sentences will be discussed later.)

May [God] give [you] health on 
my behalf ( 'for me ' ) . 

May God be praised. 

Let us rest. 

Le t them show me . 

Let them bring m [my] things 
( 'for me ') . 



These are examples of the verb form traditionally called 'Jussive'. 
This form is commonly employed m the first and third persons with meanings 
such as 'let him (her, them, me, us) do the action of the verb' or 'may he 
(she, they, I, we) do the action of the verb'. 

The Jussive has the same personal prefixes and suffixes which are used 
to form the short Imperfective except that the first person singular has an 
/l-/ before the prefix /i-/. 

The third person plural of the Jussive may have the meaning of a 'polite ' 
Imperative. Thus /yasayyun/ may mean '[Please] show me' and /yasgsbbullin/ 
'[Please] bring it (thing) m for me.' 

The distribution of vowels and root consonants of the Jussive form for 
'regular 1 verbs is as follows:

The Negative form of the Jussive is formed by affixing the negative

moSihaf occaccihun zigu. Close your books.' 

bolu. Say.' 

W9d9 fit yihidunna wodagra yizuru. G-o straight ahead and turn to the left. 

yidgemut. Repeat it.' 

These are examples of the Imperative. The Imperative is used in the 
second person masculine and feminine singular and m the second person plural 
(for several persons). In addition to these forms the third person plural of 
the Jussive is used as a polite imperative. In the examples that follow this 
form is given m parentheses for 'completeness 1 sake. It should be noted, 
however, that the second person plural Imperative is used by some speakers 
as a polite imperative, e.g. 

/siTu/ may mean both 'give (pi.) ' and 'give (pol.) '. 

The Imperative means simply 'do the action of the verb'. 

The vowel distribution of the Imperative for the regular three- and 
two- radical verbs is as follows: 

1) Three-radical type A verbs: 
Ii2e3 



Examples:

The imperative occurs only m tne affirmative. Negative commands are 
expressed by negative Jussive forms (see preceding note). 

Note that the imperative of the verb /memTat/ 'to come ' is irregular: 

na 'come (m. s. ) ' 

nay 'come (f.s.) ' 

- io nu 'come (pi. ) ' 

The jussive form of this verb is regular, i.e. 

(yimTu) 'come (pol.)'

Note 12. [f. Relational affix /iyy(a)-/ 'each' with nouns. 

balabetsm gin bayyagizew silammagannaccaw However, every time (since) I 
dahninnatsm iTayyiKaccawallahu. see your husband I ask him 

how you are. 

kazziya bahwala wadayyabetaccaw Then they each go home. 

yihedallu. (each one to his respective 

house) 

ballafaw sammmt bayyaKanu wads They went to school every day 

timihirtbet yihedu nabbar. last week. 

The affix /iyy(a)-/ (Ayy©-/ before consonants, /iyy-/ before vowels) 
prefixed to nouns with the definite suffix means 'each', e.g. /lyyabetu/ 
'each house'. Used with the preposition /ba-/ 'on' it denotes a repeated 
occurrence, e.g. /bayyagizew/ 'every time', /bayyaKanu/ 'every day', 
/bayyamatu/ 'every year', etc. Another way of expressing 'every' with days 
of the week or with /Tiwat/ 'morning', /mata/ 'evening', and /Kan/ 'day', is 
by reduplication, i.e., by saying the word twice. Thus /bayyamataw/ and 
/mata mata/ 'every evening' /bayyaTiwatu/ /Tiwat Tiwat/ 'every morning', 
/beyya Kanu/ and /Kan Kan/ 'every day' may be used interchangeably. 

Note 12.5 Relational affix /iyy(a)-/ 'while' with verbs. 

The same affix /iyy(a)-/ (/iyy-/ before /a/ and /iyya-/ elsewhere) can 
be prefixed to Perfective verb forms. 

The resulting form corresponds m meaning approximately to 'while doing 
so-and-so' or 'on doing so-and-so'. The form describes an action performed 
at the same time as that of the main verb of the sentence and, therefore, may 
refer to the pre sent- future or to the past. e.g. 

sijara lyyaCasa, maSihaf yanabbal. While smoking he's reading a book, 

sijara lyyaCasa, maSihaf yanabb nabbar. While smoking he was reading a book. 

The /iyy(a)-/ form may also denote an habitual action or state, e.g. 

abbatinna innatun lyyaTayyeKa He usually visits his parents and 

yimmallasal. comes back. 

This form may sometimes convey the meaning of 'although', 'm spite of 
the fact that', e.g. 

timihirtun maTnat lyyafallaga, wada Although he wanted to study his 

sinlmabet heda. lesson, he went to the movies. 



BASIC COURSE 



UNIT 12 



The affix /iyy(s)-/ prefixed to verbs denoting 'state' or 'condition' 
may be used m combination with the forms of the verb /mehed/ 'to go'. The 
resulting form corresponds m meaning to the English 'getting so-and-so', 
'becoming so-and-so', as for example 'getting better', 'becoming colder, etc. 
e.g. 

lyyatesalow hedo. 'He was getting better. ' 

bird lyyohone yihedal. 'It's getting colder. ' 

tilliK lyyohonhu hedhu. 'I was getting bigger. ' 

lyyazzensc tihedallec. 'She is becoming sadder. ' 

Note 12.6 Relational affix /sd)-/ 'when', while', 'as'. 

md9 ityoPiya aKKoTaTor asrazeTen 'When according to the Ethiopian 
meto hamsa ammist amot© mihrot calendar the year is 1955 

sihon. ... A.D. . . . 

•The affix /sd)-/ (/s-/ before vowels, /si-/ before /ya/ and /si-/ 
elsewhere) is prefixed to the Short Imperfective to form clauses correspond- 
ing to English 'when', 'as', or 'while' clauses. 

Example si 

bsmsngad lay sayih, sslamta 'I '11 greet you when I meet you on 

lsQTihallehu. the street. ' 

gazeTa sittanebb kebbsds meTTa. 'Kebbede came while you were reading. 

k9bbod9 maSihafun sifollig 'The teacher came while Kebbede was 

astomarlw moTTa. looking for the book. ' 

lKawm slyameTa lkof l9wall9hu. 'I '11 pay him when he brings the 

things. ' 

When the affix /sd)-/ is prefixed to the negative imperfective, the 
resulting /s-/ form corresponds m meaning to the English 'before doing 
so-and-so' 'without doing so-and-so' or 'unless doing so-and-so' according 
to the context, e.g. 

baburu saymaTa abbaten lTorallghu. 'I '11 call my father before the 

tram comes . ' 

moSihafun salaggn kozzlh alhedim. 'I won't leave unless I get the 

book. ' 

misayen salb9la W9d9 timihirtbet 'I won't go to school without 
alhedim. having my lunch. 1 



UNIT 12 



AMHARIC 



The third person singular (masculine or feminine) and plural lmper- 
fective forms of the verb /manor/ 'to exist' are used with the verb suffix 
pronouns to form the equivalents of English 'when I have', 'when you have'... 
etc., e.g. 

/moSihaf sinoron/ 'when I have a book' 

( 'when a book will exist to me ' ) 

/meSihafoc sinorun/ 'when I have books' 

( 'when books will exist to me') 

/mist sitoren/ 'when I have a wife' 

('when a wife exists to me') 

As illustrated by the above examples, the item possessed is the subject, 
/slnor-/ follows a Masculine Thing Possessed, /sitnor-/ follows a Feminine 
Thing Possessed, and /sinoru-/ follows Plural Things Possessed. 

The suffix pronoun indicates the possessor. Following is the complete 
set of these forms:

BASIC COURSE 



UNIT 13 



Note 13.1.1 /id)-/ with Short Imperfect lve 'to', 'for', 'm order', 
'so that' 

The affix /id)-/ (/l-/ before vowels, /li-/ before /ya/ and /li-/ 
elsewhere) prefixed to a Short Imperfective form means 'to do so-and-so', 
'so that', 'm order to', 'for', and is often used with verbs expressing 
desire, wish, intention, ability, etc., e.g. 

moSihaf liyanob yifolligal. 'He wants to read a book. ' 

limeTa lcilallohu. 'I can come. ' 

meSihafun lifollig moTTa. 'He came to look for the book. ' 

moSihafun liyasayyih moTTa. 'He came to show you the book. ' 

weroKot lmgoza hedn. 'We went to buy some paper. ' 

Note 13.1.2 /id)-/ with Short Imperfective form plus /now/ or /nobbor/ 
'about to do so-and-so'. 

As illustrated by the Structure Sentences the affix /id)-/ prefixed to 
a Short Imperfective form combined with the verb form /now/ indicates an 
action which is about to be performed. When used with the verb form /nobbor/ 
this affix indicates that the action was going to be performed but did not 
actually take place. 

lifollig new. 'I am going to look for [something].' 

lifollig nebber. 'He was going to look for [some- 

thing ] . ' 

Note 13.1.3 /-(i)ll(i)-/~/-d)ll9-/ 'on behalf of ', 'm favor of, 'for' 

The suffix /-( l)ll(i)-/-/- d)ll©-/ is added to the verb stem (imper- 
fective or Perfective) and followed by the verb suffix (object) pronouns. 

Using C for consonant and V for vowel, the exact shape of this suffix 
m various positions may be shown as follows: 

C - llle-t V - llo-t 

G - 1II1-C (otherwise) V - -lli-C (otherwise) 

C - lll-a V - 11-a 

This suffix indicates that the action of the verb is performed by one 
person (the subject of the verb) 'for', 'on behalf of' or 'm favor of' the 
person indicated by the verb suffix (object) pronoun. Examples: 

kobbodo lifolligillot moTTa. 'Kebbede came to look for him. ' 

littinnaggonllin now. »You are going to speak on my behalf. •

hakimu lskinogron diros mowTat 
alcilim. 



'I can't check out until the doctor 
tells me [to do sol. ' 



The affix /isk(i)-/ (/isk-/ before vowels, /iski-/ before /ya-/ and 
/iski-/ elsewhere) is prefixed to Short Imperfective verb forms, and the 
affix /isk(o)-/ (/isk-/ before vowels and /isko-/ elsewhere) is prefixed to 
Perfective verb forms. The resulting forms correspond m meaning to English 
'until' or 'till' clauses. The /isk(i)-/ and /isk(o)-/ forms are commonly used 
with the postverb /diros/ 'up to', 'as far as', but may be also used independ- 
ently without /diros/. 

Examples: 



1. / isk(i)-/ + Imperfective

Note 11+. 2 Nouni Gender. 

The masculine and feminine genders were discussed m previous 
units m connection with pronouns, definite suffixes, and the 'feminine' 
forms of verbs in the singular. 

Following is a summary of what has already been illustrated by 
venous examples which have occured m the Basic Sentences, Grammatical 
Drills and Narratives. 

Amharic does not have clear-cut gender classes. The basic 
dichotomy m singular nouns is between two usages which may often be 
characterized as augmentative and diminutive rather than as 'masculine' 
and 'feminine. ' The augmentative implies respect, large size, power, 
masculinity. The diminutive implies familiarity, affection, smallness, 
weakness, femininity. The verb forms which have up to now been referred 
to as 'masculine' are those which indicate the augmentative. The same is 
true of the personal (independent or suffix) and demonstrative pronouns. 
The verb forms and pronouns up to now referred to as 'feminine ' indicate 
the diminutive. 

Nouns generally fall into two classes with regard to these 
categories i those of fixed type (augmentative or diminutive) and those 
which may follow either type. 

Nouns referring to people or animals which are male are regularly 
used m the augmentative. Nouns referring to people or animals which are 
female are regularly used m the diminutive. 

Examples: 

/sow/ 'man' /set/ 'woman' 

/abbat/ 'father' /innat/ 'mother'

'husband ' 
'bull', 'ox' 



/ihit/ 
/akist/ 
/mist/ 
/lam/ 



'sister ' 
'aunt ' 
'wife ' 
'cow ' 



Nouns referring to sexless objects are normally (i.e. most frequently) 
augmentative. They may, however, be used as diminutives-- 1 . e . with a dimin- 
utive verb or pronoun reference—whenever their small size or any other 
diminutive aspect is stressed. Such nouns will be called neutral . 

Examples: 



/bet now/ 

' it 's a house ' 

/yih bet tilliK now/ 
'this house is big' 

/yih bet tinnis now/ 

'this house is small' 

/bet alien/ 

'I have a house ' 

/tilliK ToroPeza now/ 
' it 's a big table ' 



/bet nat/ 

'it's a small house' 

/yihicc bet tinnis nat/ 
'this house is small' 

/yihicc bet boTam tinnis noc/ 
'this house is very small' 

/bet alloccin/ 

'I have a little house ' 

/tinnis ToroPeza nat/ 
'it 's a small table ' 



A small number of nouns, such asj 

/Sohay/ or /jonbor/ 'sun' 

/CoroKa/ 'moon' 

/kokob/ 'star' 

/moret/ 'earth' 

/alom/ 'world' 

/nofs/ 'soul' 

are regularly used as diminutive but when size or other augmentative aspect 
is stressed they may be augmentative, e.g. 



/kokob woTTac/ 

'a star appeared ' 



/tilliKu kokob woTTa/ 

'the big star appeared' 



Some nouns which refer to people and animals do not specify sex (lawyer, 
cook, etc). These nouns can be modified by /wond/ 'male' or /set/ 'female'. 
The resulting phrases are then augmentative or diminutive respectively.

/astomari/ 'teacher' 

/hakim/ 'doctor'

/anbQssa/ 'lion' 
/doro/ 'chicken' 

Neutral nouns may be used with a definite suffix, the choice indicating 
what category the noun is being used in. 

Examples : 

/tomariw/ 



the (boy) student' 
/astamariw/ 'the (man) teacher' 
/hakimu/ 



/betu/ 

/wenbsru/ 

/mGSihafu/ 



'the doctor' 



'the house ' 



' the cha lr ' 



'the book' 



/tomariwa/ or /tomariyitu/ 
'the girl student ' 

/astomariwa/ or /astsmariyitu/ 
'the lady teacher' 

/hakimwa/ or /hakimitu/ 
'the woman doctor' 

/betwa/ or /betitu/ 

'the little house ' 

/wenberwa/ or /wonberitu/ 
'the little chair' 

/meSihafwa/ or/maSihaf itu/ 
'the little book' 



Note that the forms m /-(y)itu/ imply a diminutive aspect of persons, 
animals or things. 

The article may, of course, be affixed to an accompanying modifier, e.g. 



/Tiruwu tomari/ 

'the good (boy) student' 

/molkamu hakim/ 

'the good doctor ' 

/Konjow bet/ 

'the nice house ' 



/Tiruwa tomari/ or /Tiruyitu temari/ 
'the good girl student' 

/molkamwa hakim/ or /molkamitu hakim/ 
'the good woman doctor' 

/Konjowa bet/ or /Konjoyitu bet/ 
'the nice little house ' 



Neutral nouns modified by /wend/ and /set/ have the following forms when 
used with the definite suffix: 



/wendu lij/ 'the boy' 



/setwa lij/ or /setitu lij/ or /setitwa 
li j/ 'the girl ' 



171 



UNIT lk 



AMHARIC 



/wondu anbsssa/ 'the lion' /setwa anbossa/ or /setltu anbossa/ 

or /setitwa anbossa/ 'the lioness' 

The diminutive form of /and/ is /andit/, e.g. /andit tomari/ 'a girl 
student' /andit msklna/ 'a small car' 

Examples* 

/and tomari msTTa/ /andit tomari moTTac/ 

'a boy student came' 'a girl student came' 

/and bet alien/ /andit bet alloccin/ 

'I have a house ' 'I have a little house ' 

With the definite suffix the diminutive of /and/ is either /andwa/ or 
/anditwa/ e.g. /andwa temari/ or /anditwa tomari/ 'one (particular) girl 
student. 

Examples: 

andu tomari meTTa. 'one (particular) student came. ' 

andwa (or: anditwa) tsmari msTTac. 'one (particular) girl student came. ' 

andun bet ayyohut. 'I saw one (particular) house.' 

andwan (or: anditwan) bet ayyohuwat. 'I saw one (particular) small house. 1 

In the plural only nouns obviously belonging to either the masculine or 
feminine category, as well as those modified by /wend/ and /set/ are unambig- 
uous as to gender, e.g. 

/abbatoc/ 'fathers' /innatoc/ 'mothers' 

/lamoc/ 'cows ' /wend hakimoc/ or /wendoc hakimoc/ 

'doctors (m) ' 

/set hakimoc/ or /setoc hakimoc/ 
'woman doctors ' 

and with the definite suffix: 

/abbatoccu/, /mnatoccu/, /wendoccu hakimoc/, /setoc cu hakimoc/, etc. 

Note li;.3.1 Relational Affix /b(i)-/ 'if 

The affix /b(i)-/ (/b-/ before vowels, /bi-/ before /ya/ and 
/bi-/ elsewhere) prefixed to Short Imperfective verb forms corresponds m 
meaning to English 'if' e.g. /bifellig/ 'if he wants', /bimeTa/ 'if I come', 
/binorih/ 'if you have', /bayfellig/ 'if he does not want' /balmeTa/ if I 
don't come', /baynorih/ 'if you don't have', etc.

This suffix may indicate:

person indicated by the verb suffix (object) pronoun, or contrary 
to his will or intention. 

Examples « 

kebbode yalomman mskina wossodobbet. Kebbede took Lemma's car. 

(The speaker here implies that Lemma either did not want to lend Kebbede his 
car, or that Kebbede took it against Lemma's will, or else that Lemma was

UNIT 11+ 



When affixed to the verb stem /all©-/ 'have' (/alien/ 'I have', /alien/ 
'you have', etc.) this suffix may also denote an obligation (or the lack of 
it m the Negative form) . 

Thus /allebbin/ means 'I have to' /yellebbinim/ 'I don't have to', e.g. 
/mehed allebbin/ 'I have to go', /sljara maCes yellebbihim/ 'You don't have 
to smoke. ' 

The form /nebber/ with the same suffix means either 'had to' or 'should 
have done so-and-so'. 

Thus /mehed nebberebbin/ may mean either 'I had to go' or 'I should 
have gone', /memTat nebberebbet/ 'he had to come' or 'he should have come', 
etc. The meaning is determined by the context, e.g. 



tinantinna mesrat silenebberebbin 
limeTa alcalhum. 

fetena silenebberebbet innatun 
lemayet alcalem. 

mesrat silalnebberebbin innaten 
lemayet calhu. 

kefetena befit maTnat nebberebbih. 

kebbeae izzih new, beniwyork wisT 
mefelleg alnebberebbihim. 

kebbede beniwyork wisT silehone, 
lzziya mefelleg nebberebbih. 



I could not come yesterday because 
I had to work. 

He couldn't see his mother because 
he had [to take] a test. 

I could see my mother because I 
didn't have to work. 

You should have studied before 
the test. 

Kebbede is here, you shouldn't 
have looked for him m New York. 

Since Kebbede is m New York you 
should have looked for him there. 



2) that the action of the verb implies using something to accomplish 
the action. The suffix places special emphasis on the action of 
the verb (and the verb may also, of course, be used without it). 

Examples: 

Tirunes bersaswa Safeccibbet. 



baddisu mekinaccew wede wasington 
hedubbet.

ballofow sairanmt alarrofaccihum. 



You (pi.) did not rest last week. 



bommimoTaw sammmt yimoTallu. 



They'll come next week. 



In Note i|.6.1 the prefix preposition /b(s)-/ was briefly discussed as 
used with nouns and their modifiers. 

When the /y(o)-/ and /yemm( 1)-/ relative constructions (Note 10.1) are 
used as modifiers, /b(©)-/ is commonly prefixed to these constructions to 
indicate that such-and-such a thing is occurring at such-and-such time. The 
affix /y(©)-/ and the part of the affix /yemmd)-/ are lost after the 

prefix /bio)-/, e.g. 

yallofow sammmt. 'Last week' 

ballofaw sammmt meTTu. 'They came ('at') last week.' 

yommimeTaw sammmt. 'The coming week' 

bsmmimoTaw sammmt yimoTallu. 'They will come ( 'at') next week. ' 

Note ll)..5.1 /b(©)-. . .glze/ 'when' ('at the time that'). 



combination with the word /gize/ 'time'. The resulting constructions corre- 
spond m meaning to English 'when' clauses. The /b(s) - . . .gize/ constructions 
are often used with the suffix /-(l)bbot/ affixed to the /b(o)-/ relative 
form but may also be used without this suffix. The /b(o)-. . .gize/ and /sd)-/ 
clauses (see Note 12.6) are used almost interchangeably; the /b ( 9 ) - . . . gize/ 
constructions, however, emphasize more specifically the time element of the 
sentence, e.g. 

kobbodo simoTa, W9d9 bete ihedall9hu. 'When Kebbede comes I'll go home.' 

k9bb9d9 b9mmim9Tabbg t gize W9d9 bete 'I '11 go home at the time of 

lhedallohu. Kebbede 's coming.' 

The second Amharic sentence implies that the speaker will go home at the 
specific time when Kebbede is supposed to come. Whether Kebbede actually 
comes or not is immaterial. 

Note 11+.5.2 /b(o) - . . .KuTir/ 'whenever', 'every time'. 

The same constructions are used m combination with the word 
/KuTir/ 'number ' to correspond m meaning to English 'whenever ' or 'everytime ' 
clauses. The suffix /-(l)bbot/ may or may not be used, e.g. 



The relative forms with the prefix /b(o)-/ are commonly used in

Note lif.6 /b(o) 



mikniyat/ 'because', 'because of the fact that', 'since'. 



/b(e)-/ prefixed to nouns or verbal nouns ('infinitives') with 
noun suffix ('possessive') pronouns produces constructions corresponding 
approximately to 'because' or 'since' clauses m English. The word /mikniyat/ 
may optionally follow the construction.

'He didn't see his mother because 
he didn't have enough money [to

Note 11+.7 Relational affix /sil (a)- ~silamm( 1) -/ 'because', 'since', 'as'; 
'about (concerning) 1

'Because I have some work [to do].. 



/sil(a)-/ (/sila-/ before consonants, /sil-/ before vowels) is prefixed 
to Perfective verb forms and /silammd)-/ (/silammi-/ before /ya/, /silamm-/ 
before vowels, /silammi-/ elsewhere) to the Short Imperfective verb forms.

The resulting forms correspond m meaning to English 'because', 'since' 
or 'as' subordinate clauses, e.g. /silomeTTa/ 'because he came', /silommimoTa/ 
'because he's coming'. 

/sil(o)-/ is also prefixed to other parts of speech (nouns, modifiers, 
pronouns, verbal nouns, etc.) with the meaning 'about', 'concerning', e.g. 

/silamerika ToyyoKo/ 'He asked about America. ' 

/silorsu noggoron/ 'He told me about him. ' 

/silemm/ 'About what? ' 

When prefixed to the /y(e)- ~yemm(i)/ relative forms, the /y(e)-/ part 
of these affixes is lost, e.g. 



/yayyon sew/ 
/silayyorl sew/ 
/yommiyayon sow/ 
/silommiyayon sew/ 



'a person who saw me ' 
'about a person who saw me ' 
'a person who sees me' 
'about a person who sees me ' 



When the affix /silo-/ is prefixed to /yollonnim, yellohim/, etc. 'I 
don't have, you don't have', etc., the resulting form is* /silolellofi/, 
silolelleh/ etc. 'because I don't have, because you don't have', etc.

Grammatical Notes 

Note 15.1 Verbi /a-/ verbs. 

A number of Amharic verbs have an /a-/ as the first element of 
the Perfective form. Most of the three-radical verbs of this kind belong 
either to type A or B according to their infinitive forms. Thus: 

if the Infinitive is ma293, the Imperfective is -a23- (Type A) 

if the Infinitive is ma2293, the Imperfective is -a22i3- (Type B)

Miss Almaz. 

'What shall I bring you, sir? 

'Since I am sick I have to go to 
the hospital. 

'Have them bring my things. ' 

'I '11 show [it] to him. ' 



The prefixes /a-/ and /as-/ are affixed to the Perfective form to produce 
so-called 'causative' verb forms. 



Note 15.2.1 Causative verbs m /a-/. 

The meaning of the causative verbs m /a-/ may be either 'caus- 
ative' or 'transitive'. In some cases the meaning may be different from its 
'simple' form, its ' causativeness ' being clear from its literal translation 
only. 



Sentence It 

/derrese/ 
/aderress/

Sentence 3: 

/Korrobo/ 
/aKorrebo/ 



Infinitive: /moKrob/ 'to come near' 

Infinitive: /maKreb/ 'to bring near, to present, 

to fetch 



The vowel distribution of the causative verbs m /a-/ is the same as 
that of their respective simple forms, except for the regular loss of /1/ 
before /a/ (see Note 3«3), e.g. /lmoTallohu/ 'I'll come', /yimoTal/ 'he'll 
come', /amoTallohu/ 'I'll bring', /yamsTal/ 'he'll bring'.

BASIC COURSE 



UNIT Ik 



Note 15.2.2 Causative verbs m /as-/. 

The prefix /as-/ is used to indicate that the action of the verb 
is performed by a person other than the subject of the verb, e.g. 

/gabba/ 'he entered' 

/asgobba/ 'he had someone bring m something or somebody' 

(Sentence 5) 

/foliage/ 'he looked for', 'he wanted' 

/asfollogo/ 'he had someone look for something', 

'it was necessary' ('caused to want') 
(Sentence k) 

The prefix /as-/ may also be used to form verbs from nouns, e.g. 

/dirsat/ 'narrative' 

/asdarrasa/ 'he caused to narrate ' 

/a-/ verbs (Note 15>*2»l) never have an /a-/ prefix, but they may have 
an /as-/ prefix. The form with the /as-/ prefix may have either a transitive 
or a causative meaning, e.g., 

/ayya/ 'he saw' 

/asayya/ 'he showed' ('caused someone to see') 

/allefe/ 'passed' (intr.) 

/asallafa/ 'passed' 'spent' (Trans.) or 'caused to pass' 

All causative /as-/ verbs formed from three-radical verbs type A and B, 
are type B verbs, e.g. 

/keffele - makfal - yikoflal/ 'to divide' (type A) 

/askoffolo - maskaffal - yaskoffilal/ 'to cause to divide' (type B) 

/f allege - mafelleg - yifalligal/ 'to want' (type B) 

/asfallage - masfelleg - yasfelligal/ 'to need' (type B)

BASIC COURSE 



UNIT llj. 



As these examples show, passive- reflexive verbs are formed by prefixing 
/tie)-/ (/ta-/ before consonants and /t-/ before /a/) to the perfective stem 
of a verb. 



Examples: 



/kaffolo/ 
/awwaKa/ 
/s9rra/ 
/ammama/ 



'he paid ' 
'he knew ' 
'he did' 
'it ached' 



/t9k9ff9l9/ 

/tawwaKa/ 
/t9S9rra/ 
/tamm9m9/ 



' it was paid ' 
'it was known' 
'it was done ' 
'he was sick' 



There are no passive-reflexive forms of causative verbs m /a-/ and 
/as-/. Instead there is a passive-reflexive m /t(a)-/ which is based on 
the simple form and has both the basic and causative meanings. 



Examples: 

Causative 

/ag9bba/ 'he caused to 
enter', 
'he married 

/asayya/ 'he showed 



Simple 
/gabba/ 'he entered' 



/ayyo/ 'he saw' 



Passive 
/tgggbba/ 'he was married' 



/tayya/ 



'it was seen 
or 

'it was shown ' 



There are verbs with the causative /a-/ prefix which have no correspond- 
ing independent simple form. The meanings of these verbs may not reflect any 
'causative' nature. However these verbs have passive-reflexive forms which 
are constructed on the simple base, not the one m /a-/, like other causative 
verbs, e.g. 



/ad9rrag9/ 'he did' 

/aganfta/ 'he found' 

/am9S9gg9no/ 'he praised' 

/abgddorg/ 'he loaned' 



/t9dorrog9/ 'it was done' 

/tog9nn9/ 'he/it was found' 

/tamgsaggana/ 'he/it was praised' 

/tobgddgrg/ 'he borrowed' 



Notice that m all the examples given so far, the passive-reflexive 
prefix /t(a)-/ has come at the beginning of the verb form. However, if 
there should be another prefix before the passive-reflexive prefix (e.g. 
the infinitive prefix /mo-/ or the imperfect lve prefix /yi-/) then the form 
of the passive-reflexive prefix is not /t(a)-/, but is instead a doubling 
of the initial consonant of the verb stem:

'If you want some other kind we 
can prepare it. 



The affix /k(o)-/ may be prefixed to Perfective verb forms to express 
simple condition. 

In conditional clauses referring to the future, a Prefective form with 
the affix /k(g)-/ has almost the same meaning as a Short Imperfective form 
with the affix /bd)-/ (see Note II4..3). It seems, however, that the /k(e)-/ 
form implies more doubt on the part of the speaker than the /bd)-/ form, e.g. 

bimoTa, lhedallshu. 'If he comes, I'll go.' 

komoTTa, lhedallshu. 'If he does come, I'll go.' 

When /k(e)-/ is prefixed to the verb stems /alio-/ and /yollo-/ the

Note 15.5.2 /k(o)-/ 'since' 



When the verb of the main clause is m the past tense the affix 

/k(o)-/ corresponds in meaning to the English 'since ' (from the time of) . The 

word /jommiro/ (Gerund of the verb /mojommor/ 'to begin') may be added op- 
tionally to this construction.

'My son has not written me a letter 
since he left for Addis. 

'It has been a long time since 
they got permission. ' 

'He did not work from the time he 
got money. ' 



The use of /k(o)-/ 'from' as a preposition was discussed m Unit 5-5. 1. 
It is the same preposition which is used m combination with /jommiro/ m the 
sense of 'since', e.g. 



komoskorom jommiro gonzob 
alagennohum. 

kallofow sammint jommiro wode 
timihirtbet alhedkum. 



'I haven't gotten any money since 
September. ' 

'I haven't been to school since 
last week. ' 



/k(o)- . . . 39mmiro/ may be used m combination with /isk(o ) - . . . diros/ 
(Note 5.5.2) 'from... up to', e.g. 



kaddis aboba jommiro 
lskoharor diros ammist 
meto kilometir yahil now. 

kozare jommiro lskosost wor diros 
lzzih iKoyyallshu. 



'It's about 500 Kms. from Addis

Grammatical Notes 

Note 16.1 Relational Affix - /md(i)-/ 'that', 'so that', 'in order to', 

T9jj mdittam9Tallm 'I don't want you to bring 

alfelligim. me mead. ' 

The Affix /md(i)-/ (/mdl-/ before /ya/, /md-/ before /a/ and /mdi-/ 
elsewhere) may be prefixed to a Short Imperfective form. The resulting form 
is used m connection with another verb and is most frequently equivalent to 
an English verb phrase with 'to... ' ('to bring' m the above example). It 
should be noted however that this form indicates the actor of the verb. The 
literal translation of this form is, therefore, 'that I come', 'that he bring' 
etc. The affix /id)-/, prefixed to a Short Imperfective form (Note 13. l), 
has approximately the same meaning as /mdd)-/. Their usage, however, is 
basically different. Whereas /id)-/ refers to the subject (actor) of the • 
mam verb, as in /msSihafun llfellig m9TTa/ 'He came to look for the book' 
('He came that he look for the book'), /indd)-/ refers to a person (or 
persons) other than the subject (actor) of the mam verb, as m /meSihafun 
mdifellig neggerQn/ 'He told me to look for the book. 1 ( 'He tpld me that 
I look for the book'). 

Examples* 

mditmsTa if alligallshu. 'I want you to come. ' 

mdihed TgyyeKew. 'He asked him to go. ' 

msSihafun mdlyanebbu 'I told them to read the book. ' 
n9gg9rhuwacc9w. 

The form with /indd)-/ may also be used as a less abrupt command form 
(imperative) e.g. 

hid 'goJ ' mdithed 'be sure to go' 

bglla 'eatJ ' mditb9la 'be sure to eat' 

attikfotu 'don't open (pi.)' mdatkgftu 'be sure not to open' 

Note 16.2 Pronoun /ras-/ 'self' 

l9rase y9doro woT if glligallghu. 'For myself I'd like spiced 

chicken. 1 



208 



BASIC COURSE 



UNIT 16 



The pronoun /ras-/ 'self, 'oneself, used with noun suffix pronouns 
means 'myself, yourself, etc.: 



rase 


'myself ' 


rasih 


'yourself (m.s 


rasis 


'yourself (f.s

rasu 


'himself ' 


raswa 


'herself ' 


rasaccm 


'ourselves ' 


rasaccihu 


'yourselves '

/ras-/ is used as an emphatic word with the independent pronoun, as m 
/me rase lhedallohu/ 'I'll go myself. It may also be used as a reflexive 
pronoun as in /rasen lofotena azzega j jallohu/ 'I prepare myself for the exam. '

Since the Perfective and the Imperfective forms are predictable from 
their infinitive, only the infinitive of these verbs will be listed m the 
build-ups. 

Note 16.1]. Verb: Three- and four-radical verbs m /-o-/. 

Some of the three-radical verbs type B and some four-radical 
verbs have an /of after the double consonant of the perfective form. These 
verbs have an /u/ after the double consonant of the imperfective form, e.g. 

c9Kkol9 - m9C9kkol - yicekkulal 'to hurry' 

tor9ggom9 - m9t9rgom - yitorgggumal 'to translate' 



Note 16.5 Verb: Noun of Agent. 

The Noun of Agent is formed by affixing the suffix /-i/ to the 
past stem of the verb and by certain changes of its vowel distribution. If 
the last radical (consonant) of the verb stem is one of the eight dental or 
alveolar consonants /t/, /d/, /t/, /s/, /s/, /z/, /n/, /l/, the latter and 
the suffix /-i/ are replaced by the corresponding palatal consonant (see 
Notes 9.3) . 

Here are some examples of Nouns of Agent which have occurred m our 
units: 



/tgmari/ 

/ast9mari/ 

/ascgggari/ 

/t9K9bbay/ 
/asallafl/

'be taught 1 

'he caused 

difficulties ' 

'he accepted ' 
'he waited on' 



210 



BASIC COURSE 



UNIT 16 



A Noun of Agent may be a noun (one who perforins the action of the verb, 
or one characterized by the action of the verb), e.g. /tomari/ 'student', or 
a modifier /ascoggari/ 'difficult'. 

All Nouns of Agent formed from Type B Verbs double their second conso- 
nant, as m /fellagl/ those formed from the Type A Verbs do not , as m 
/no gar 1/. 

The distribution of vowels is as follows: 

Regular Three- and Four- Radical Verbs . 

The vowel before the last consonant is replaced by /a/. Other vowels 
are the same as those of the perfective stem (e.g. Perfective stem /fellog-/ 
Noun of Agent /follagl/) except for the Nouns of Agent formed from the three- 
radical causative verbs in /a-/, Type A, where the vowel before the second 
radical is lost, e.g. /aKorrebo/ (Type A) - /aKrabi/ (but /abeddoro/ (Type B) 
- /aboddari/) , and those formed from the four- radical verbs where the vowel, 
before the third-radical is lost (/menozzoro/ - /monzari/) .

Regular Two-Radical Verbs ; 



The vowels are the same as m the perfective form, except for causatives 
in /a-/. 

Where there is a replacement of dentals or alveolar s by the palatals, 
the suffix /-i/ is usually maintained, as m /ssTTo/ - /sqCI/, but the form 
/seC/ is used by some speakers. 

Other examples:

Note 16.6 Verbt Noun of Instrument 



Nouns indicating the instrument used or the place of a given actio 
are formed by affixing the suffix /-iya/ to the Infinitive. Final dental or 
alveolar consonants (and the /iy/ of the suffix) are replaced by the corre- 
sponding palatals. 



Examples: 



Infinitive 



Noun of Instrument 



/moKom/ 
/msCerrGs/ 
/me jomm9r/ 
/mamolko t/ 
/mettawoK/ 



'to stand' 
'to end' 
'to begin' 
'to apply' 
'to be known ' 



/msKomiya/ 
/m9C9rr9sa/ 
/m9 j9mm9riya/ 
/mam9lk9ca/ 
/m9ttaw9Klya/ 



'a stop ' 
'an end' 
'beginning ' 
'application ' 
'identification ' 



The vowel distribution m the nouns of instrument is the same as in the 
infinitive. The infinitives which have suffixes /-9t/ or /-at/, as for 
example /m9sT9t/ 'to give', or /m9^gbat/ 'to enter', form their nouns of 
instrument by affixing the suffix /-iya/ to the last radical, as m /mggbiya/ 
'entrance', /m9sriya/ 'instrument', or with a palatal: /mgTgCCa/ 'cup'. 

The nouns of instrument indicate a thing which is used to perform the 
action of the verb or a place where the action of the verb is performed.

rain. 

it may ram yizenb yihonal 

It may ram tomorrow though mmalbat nege yizenb yihonal. 

( 'perhaps ' ) . 



Grammatical Notes 

Note 18.1 Verb: The use of /yihonal/ 'may be', 'may', 'might'. 

mmalbat nege yizenb yihonal. 'It may ram tomorrow though 

( 'perhaps ' ) . 

The form /yihonal/ * (i.e. the imperfective of the verb /mehon/ 'to become' 
'to happen') is used with various parts of speech as an equivalent to English 
'may be ', e.g. 

anbessa yihonal. 'It may be a lion. ' 

Tiru yihonal. 'It may be good. ' 

issu yihonal. 'It may be he. ' 

kebbede yemeTTaw lemssrat yihonal. 'Kebbede may have come m order 

to work ( 'Kebbede 's coming 
may be for working ' ) . 

The same form is put immediately after a Short Imperfective form of a 
verb to indicate that the action of the verb may take place, e.g. 

yihed yihonal 'he may go' 

yigeba yihonal 'he may enter ' 

yif ollig yihonal 'he may want ' 

When used with the gerund, the form /yihonal/ indicates that the action of 
the verb might have taken place, e.g. 

he do yihonal. 'He might have gone. ' 

gabtow yihonal. 'They might have entered. ' 

felliga yihonal. 'She might have wanted. ' 



/yihon yihonal/ with some speakers. 



233 



UNIT 18 



AMHARIC 



The verb form /yihonal/ is often used with the word /mmalbat/ 'perhaps', 

e.g. 

mmalbat yihed yihonal. 'Perhaps he may go. ' 

mmalbat meSihafun agnitaw yihonal. 'Perhaps she might have gotten 

the book. ' 

Instead of the above verb constructions (i.e. imperfective plus /yihonal/ 
and gerund plus /yihonal/), the relative clauses /yemmd)-/ and /y(e)-/may 
be used without changing the meaning of the sentence, e.g. 

/ato lemma bebabur yimeTa yihonal/ 

or 'Mr. Lemma may come by train' 

/ato lemma yemmlmeTaw bebabur yihonal/ 

and 

/ato lemma bebabur meTto yihonal/ 

or 'Mr. Lemma might have come by train' 

/ato lemma yemeTTaw bebabur yihonal/ 



Note 18.2 The use of /gena/ 'yet', 'still', 'just'. 

ahun Sihifete gena Tiru aydellem. 'My writing is not good yet. » 

According to the context the word /gena/ may correspond to various 
meanings m English, e.g. 

gena sirayen alCerreshum. 'I haven't finished my work yet . ' 

gena wede timihirtbet lhedallehu. 'I still go (or: I'll still have 

to go) to school. ' 

and in combination with /ahun/ 'now': 

misawm ahun gena bella. 'He has just finished his lunch, 

ahun gena Tiru sira serrah. 'Now finally you did a good job. ' 

In answer to a question /gena/ combined with a form of the verb 'be ' 
(i.e. /nen, neh, nes/ etc.) corresponds in meaning to English 'not yet', e.g. 

sirahm Cerrisehal t 'Have you already finished to 

work? ' 

gena nen. 'Not yet.' ' 

timihirtwan Gerresect 'Did she complete her education?' 

gena nec. 'Not yet. '

Grammatical Notes 
Note 23.1 The Plural affix /inn(e)-/

leloc toKlay gizatoc innsman around Addis Ababa? 

naccew. 

yodoro W9T kormQ inKulalwa. The chicken stew with eggs. 

The affix /innle)-/ is prefixed to the question word /man/ 'who', 'what' 
to indicate that the question refers to more than one thing or person. This 
is the same affix which is prefixed to personal and demonstrative pronouns m 
their plural forms, as m /anto/ 'you (sing).) - /mnanto/ 'you (pi.), /issu/ 
'he' - /mnossu/ 'they', /yih/ 'this' - /mnozzih/ 'these', etc. 

The affix /inn( e ) -/ with the prefix preposition /k(o)-/ means 'includ- 
ing', 'with', e.g. /konnoli joccu moTTa/ 'he came with his children'. /mn(o)-/ 
may be also prefixed to the names of persons (or to their titles, ranks, etc.) 
to indicate that this person is not alone but is either a member of a group, 
e.g. /mnato kobbGde suK/ 'the store of Mr. Kebbede and his associates', or 
that this person is accompanied by some other persons, e.g. /mnato kobbad© 
meTTu/ 'Mr. Kebbede and his group came'. 

Note that when the noun with the prefix /inn(a)-/ is the subject of the 
sentence the verb is m the plural. 

Examples i 

innsman meTTu. 

lnnsmannin tawKalloh. 

mnezzih sewoc mnoman naccow

The form /innoraan/ (plural of /man/) discussed m Note 23.1 is often 
replaced by /manman/, e.g. 

innezzih sgwoc manman naccew. 'Who are these people?

There is however a slight difference m the response to these question words. 
The answer to the /manman/ question is a complete enumeration of persons or 
things referred to m the question. The answer to the /mneman/ question 
may consist m naming just one person, e.g.

Grammatical Notes 



Note 2l|.l Short form of /ma drag/ 'to do', 'to make' 

balammistmna balassirbirr yargullin. Make it five and ten dollar 

bills (for me) . 

The form /marag/ (short form of /madrag/) 'to do, ' 'to make' is used by 
some Amharic speakers. 

Other forms of this verb are: 

Imperfective /yaragal/ 
Jussive /yarg/ 
Imperative /arg/ 



Note 21;. 2 The use of /giddeta/ 'obligation', 'necessity' with /allabbin/, 

/allabbih/, /allabbat/ etc.; /honabbin/, /honabbih/, /honabbat/ 
etc., and /nabbar abb in/, /nabbarabbih/, /nabbarabba t/, etc. 

wada lela bank hejje giddeta cek 'I have to go to another bank and 

mamanzar allabbin. cash the check. ' 

In Note li|.2 the use of the suffix /- ( l) bb( l) ( 1) bba-/ with the verb 

forms /alia-/ and /nabbar-/ was discussed. 

The forms /alia/ and /nabbar/, and also the form /hona/, when combined 
with the suffix /- ( i)bb( i)--- ( i)bba-/, express obligation or necessity. The 
sense of urgency or compulsion may be enhanced by adding the word /giddeta/ 
to the construction. 



283 



UNIT 2-k 



AMHARIC 



Examples: 



ygzare sammint abbaten mayet 
allabbiff. 

Kidame libs lomogzat w©de kotoma 
mehed giddeta allobbin. 

bommimGTaw amot timihirten msCgrrgs 
asfellagi honGbbin. 

rasen silammGmGn haklmun ma yet 
giddeta honGbbin. 



'I have to see my father next 
week. 1 

'I absolutely have to go downtown 
to buy some clothes on Saturday. ' 

'I must complete my studies by 
the next year. ' 

•Since I have a headache I 
(absolutely) must see the 
doctor. ' 



Note that the verb forms /alio-/ and /hono-/ with the suffix /-(i)bb(i)- 
— /(i)bb9-/ may be used almost interchangeably, /hone-/, however, may imply 
that the action has to be performed by the actor under compulsion. 

The verb form /nsbbare/ with the suffix /-d)bb(i) (i)bbG-/ may mean 

either 'had to' or 'should have done so-and-so', e.g. 

'He should have gone (or t he had 
to go) to Ethiopia last year. 1

m9f9rr9m giddeta n9bb9r9bbacc9W. 



'They really should have signed 
(or: had to sign) this letter 
two years ago. ' 

As illustrated by the above examples the word /giddeta/ is used for 
emphasis only and may be left out. 

/giddeta/ used with the prefix (b(g)-/ corresponds m meaning to the 
English 'by force', e.g. 



lebaw bogiddeta g9nz9bun 

W9SS9d9bb9t . 



'The thief took his money by 
force. '

Grammatical Notes 



Note 25.1 Repetition and Reduplication. 



292 



BASIC COURSE 



UNIT 25 



Note 2£.1.1 Repetition 

The repetition of nouns was discussed m Note 12, l\. (/mata mata/ 
'every evening', /Tiwat Tiwat/ 'every morning', /lhud lhud/ 'every Sunday', 
etc.) and that of the pronouns m Note 23.2.1 (/man man/ 'who' (pi.), /mm mm/ 
'which', ' wha t ( pi . ) ) 

As stated m the Note 12. i| the repetition of nouns denoting days 
of the week and that of the nouns denoting 'day', 'night', 'evening', 'morning' 
etc. indicate their repeated occurance, e.g. 

mata mata yizonbal. 'It rams every evening. ' 

Tiwat Tiwat mm tadorgallah. 'What are you doing every morning. ' 

Kidame Kidame wedosinimabe t 'We go to the movies every Saturday. ' 

mhedallon. 

The repetition of pronouns (Note 23.2.1) indicates that these pronouns 
refer to the nouns m plural. 

manman yimoTallu. 'Who (pi.) is going to come.'' 

mmmm tawKalleh. 'What [things] do you know?' 

The word /and/ 'one' has the form /andand/ meaning 'some', e.g. 
andand sewoc meTTu. 'some people came. 



e.g. 



The repeated adjectives emphasize the plurality of nouns they modify, 

donna dahna sawoc moTTu. 'Many good people came. ' 

bizu bizu setoc yimoTallu. 'A lot of women will come. ' 

meTfo msTfo irsasocc algazam. 'I 'm not going to buy a lot of 

bad pencil. ' 

saffi saffi betocc isarallahu. 'I'm going to build many large 

houses. ' 



Note 25.1.2 Partial Reduplication. 

batililliK kotemawoc hullu 'It has local offices m every large 

KrmCafocc allut. city ('in large cities'). 

Some Amharic adjectives indicating dimensions or colors have reduplicated 
forms when modifying nouns m plural. 



293

Examples i 



/tilliK katema/ 


'a

/tililliK (ori tilalliK) 

ketamawoc/ 'large cities ' 


/tmnis wanbar/

/Kayy makina/ 


'a 


red car' 


/Keyayy makinawoc/ 


'red cars ' 


/TiKur beKlo/ 


'a 


black mule ' 


/TiKwaKur beKlowoc/ 'black mules ' 



The reduplicating element, as seen from the above examples, is a single 
consonant plus vowel, reduplicating the double consonant of the word, so 
/ra-jj-im/ is reduplicated /ra- ja- j jim/. 

Using C for consonants, this reduplication may be shown as follows: 



After The reduplication is 

-a - -Ga 

- 1 - -Ci- or -Ca- 

(-)a- -Ca- 



Note that m case of /wafram - wafafrarn/ the reduplicated consonant is 
single. Note also that the last example is of single /K/ followed by /u/. 
The reduplication is /Kwa/. (The /w/ may be said to be due to /u/) . 

Note 2^.1.3 Complete reduplication 

In addition to the partially reduplicated forms mentioned m the 
above note, some adjectives denoting colors may have completely reduplicated 
forms with the sense of 'somewhat' (compare the English suffix '-ish' m 
'blackish' 'whitish', etc.) 

Examples : 

Kayy - red KayyaKeyy - 'reddish' 

naCC - white naCCaneCC - 'whitish' 

TiKur - black TiKuraTiKur - 'blackish' 

The reduplication is the whole word connected by the vowel /a/.

Note 25.2 /mm madrogiya new/ 'what is it used for' 



In Note 16.6 the formation of Nouns of instrument was discussed. 
The noun of instrument of the verb /ma dreg/ 'to do', 'to perform', is often 
used m the sense 'something which is used for'. Thus the question /yih mm 
madregiya now/ corresponds approximately in meaning to the English 'what is 
it used for ', e.g. 



Question ; 

meSihaf mm madregiya now. 

Answer : 

meSihaf manbebiya new. 



'What is a book used for? ' 



'A book is used for reading.

Grammatical Notes 

Note 27.1 Suffix /-o/ 'pertaining to' m compound words. 

In Note 6.1 the use of the prefix /yU)-/ equivalent to English 
'of (or the apostrophe-plus- s possessive suffix) was discussed. The same 
'possessed-possessor' relationship is sometimes expressed by the suffix /-&/ 
m compound Geez *^ loan words. 



Here are some 


examples taken from 


the previous units: 


/beta kristiyan/ 


'church ' 




('house of Christians') 


/betes 9b/ 


'family ' 




( 'house of man ' ) 


/bete moSahift/ 


'library ' 




( 'house of books ' ) 


/beta msngist/ 


'palace ' 




( 'house of the government 


/agore gszi/ 


'governor ' 




('ruler of the country') 


/ba lobe t/ 


' spouse ' 




( 'house owner ' ) 


/balosilTan/ 


'authorities 


1 


('possessor of the power' 


/haylosillase/ 


'Haile Selass 


lie ' 


('power of Trinity') 


/amoto mihrot/ 


'A.D. ' 




( 'the year of Mercy') 


/niguso nogest/ 


'Emperor ' 




( 'king of kings ' ) 


/zomGno yohannis/ 


'The year of 


John ' 





.) 

Geez is now a dead language. It was spoken m Ethiopia until the 
end of the first part of the Middle Ages. Its position m contem- 
porary Ethiopia may be compared with that of Latin m the Western 
world. Geez is still the only liturgical language of the Coptic 
Church.

BASIC COURSE 



UNIT 27 



Note 27.2 The use of plural after numerals. 

The plural suffix /-(w)oc(c)/ (Note 3.6) is not necessarily used 
m Amharic after numerals. Thus some speakers may say /sost meSihaf alien/ 
'I have three books' or /sost sew meTTa/ 'three people came' instead of more 
common /sost meSihafocc a Hun/ and /sost sawoc meTTu/. 

It should also be noted that the word /birr/ 'dollar' is not 
pluralized m Amharic after a numeral, e.g. 

sost birr alien. 'I have three dollars'. 

Note 27.3 The use of /and . . . yemmihon(u)/ m equivalent to English 
'approximately', 'about', 'around', 'some'. 

kebank and asrammist birr 'I withrew some fifteen dollars 

awTiccallehu. from the bank'. 

botimihirtbetaccGW wisT sost 'There are about three thousand 

si yemmihonu temariwoc yiggennallu. students m their school'. 

The word /and/ 'one ' combined with the form /yemmihon(u) / is used to 
modify nouns. The resulting construction corresponds m meaning to English 
'approximately', 'about', 'around', 'some', e.g. 

and assir meSihafoc yemmihonu 'I have about ten books', 

allun. 

Either of the words /and/ or /yemmihonu/ may be left out. Thus the 
above sentence may also be said: 

/and assir meSihafocc allun/ or /assir meSihafoc yemmihonu allun/ 

without changing the meaning. 

If the noun modified by the numeral is m singular (see Note 27.3 above) 
the form /yemmihon/ is used in lieu of /yemmihonu/, e.g. 

and assir birr yemmihon alien. 'I have about ten dollars'. 

and sost sew yemmihon meTTa. 'About three persons came'. 

It should be noted that whenever the speaker wishes to express a small 
number of units of a given substance, (such as 'five litres of gasoline', 
'three kilograms of sugar', etc.) he may use the feminine form /yemmittihon/ 
m equivalent to English 'approximately', etc., e.g. 

and sost litir yemmittihon 'I have just three litres of 

benzin bicca alleccin. gasoline'. 

The construction /and. . .yemmihon(u)/ may be used interchangeably with 
/and. . .yah.il/. 



311 



UNIT 27 



AMHARIC 



Thus the sentence 'I have about three thousand dollars' may also be said 
m Amharic: /and sost si birr yahil alien/ ort /and sost si birr alien/, 
or t /sost si birr yahil alien/.

'If I weren't an old man, I

In note 11+. 3 the use of simple and indefinite conditional was discussed. 
The sentence above illustrates the use of unreal or hypothetical conditional. 
The Hypothetical Conditional is formed as follows t 

Mam clause i Affix /b(a)-/ prefixed to Perfective verb forms, plus 
the verb form /nabbar/. 

' If' clause : Affix /b(i)-/ prefixed to short imperfective forms, 
plus the verb form /noro/.

Note 28.2 Verbi Affix /md(o)-/ used with verb forms /alio-/ and /hone/. 



wond woyim set lijocc mdalluwo, 
wodamerika melak yicilallu. 



'If you have children you can 
send them to America. ' 



In Note 10.2.1 various /ind(o)-/ constructions were discussed. The 
sentence above illustrates the use of this affix with the verb form /alio-/ 
plus object suffix pronouns. 

The resulting forms correspond usually to the 'if sentences m English. 
The basic difference between the forms /binoren/, /blnorih/, /binorew/, etc. 
'If I have', 'if you have', 'if he has', etc. and /mdallon/, /mdallsh/, 
/mdallow/, etc. 'If I have', 'if you have', 'if he has', etc. consists m 
the fact that while the /b(i)-/ forms refer more to the future situation the 
/ind(9)-/ forms refer rather to a condition existing at the moment of speak- 
ing. 



Examples: 



gize blnorih, wods slnlmabet 
mnihid. 

gize mdallQh, wsda slnlmabet 
innihid. 

genzob binorsw, wsdamerlka 
yihedal.

anhedim. 

moShafoc binoraccow, wedo 
timihirtbet yihedallu. 

moShafocc mdallaccaw wods 
timihirtbet yihedallu. 



'If you have time let's go to 
the movies. ' 

'If you have time ( 'right now') 
let's go to the movies. ' 

'If he has money he '11 go to 
America. ' 

'If he has money ( 'right now') 
he'll go to America'. 

'If we are busy we won't go to 
the movies . ' 

'If we're busy ('right now') 
we won't go to the movies. ' 

'If they have books they'll go 
to school. ' 

'If they have books (right now) 
they'll go to school.' 



The affix /md(e)-/ may be prefixed to the perfective of the verb 
/mohon/. The resulting forms (i.e. /mdohonhu/, /md9honh/, /lndGhone/, 
etc., may be said to correspond more frequently to an English meaning, such 
as 'if it is the case that I am, you are, he is, it is/ etc. ('right now'), 
while the /b(i)-/ forms may be said to correspond more frequently to ' if I 
am, if you are, if he is, if it is, ' etc. (in the future). 



318 



BASIC COURSE 



UNIT 28 



Examples: 



'If the weather is good tomorrow, 
I '11 go to the mountains. ' 

'If the weather is gobd ( 'right 
now') I'll go to the moun- 
tains . ' 

'If he is ('proves to be ' ) a 
good student I '11 send him 
to America . ' 

'If this is the case that he is 
a good student, I '11 send 
him to America . ' 

'If he's going to be a student 
he can get a job. ' 

'If it is the case that he is 
a student he can get a job. ' 

'If she turns out to be a pretty- 
girl she'll find a husband.' 

'If she's a pretty girl she'll 
find a husband. ' 

'If he proves to be educated 
he'll go to Europe. 

'If he is ('right now') an 
educated person he '11 go 
to Europe . 

As stated m Note 10.2 the /md(o)-/ constructions may also correspond 
to the English 'as soon as' clauses. The meaning of these constructions 
may, therefore, be ambiguous. Thus, for example, the sentence /gonzob 
mdallow wodamerika yihedal/ may mean both 'if he has money he'll go to 
America' and 'he'll go to America, as soon as he has money'.

AMHARIC 



mem ribonnal Tomtonnalim. 



'And I 'm both hungry and thirsty. 



Impersonal constructions were discussed m Note 20.2. The above examples 
illustrate the use of the Impersonal Verbs, i.e. verbs that can be used only 
m impersonal constructions which consist of a third person singular masculine 
verb form plus a suffix (object) pronoun. 



Examples : 



rabon ort ribonnal. 
yiribonnal. 

ammomaccihu _or» ammowaccihuwal . 
ammowaccihu nebbor. 
yamma c c lhuwa 1 . 



•I 'm hungry ' 

'I '11 be hungry ' 

'you (pi.) are sick' 

'you (pi.) were sick' 

'you (pi.) will be sick' 



These examples show that both the Perfective and the Present Perfect 
forms refer to the situation existing at the time pf speaking ('I'm hungry', 
'you're sick'). It should also be noted that the Amharic Impersonal verbs 
are transitive and may, therefore, have a direct object, as m /rasen ammonnal/ 

'I have a headache' ('it hurts my head'), /mjsra ribonnal/ 'I l ara hungry 
('for bread'), /wiha Teratonal/ 'we are thirsty ('for water') '.

Note 29.2 The use of /mikmyatu/ 'the reason' in combination with /silo-/ 
and /silommd)-/ forms followed by /new/. 



mkniyatum gabazoccu mgidoccaccswin 
Iamasd9ss9t bizu aynat migbinna 
mgTeTT silommiyazzgga 3 ju n9W. 



'and this is because the hosts 
prepare all sorts of meals 
and drinks in order to please 
their guests ' . 



mikniyatum g9nz9b silagann9hu 
n9w. 



The word /mikniyat/ 'reason' with or without the definite suffix /-u/ 
may be used optionally in combination with /sil9-/ and /sil9imn( 1)-/ forms. 
The resulting constructions plus the verb form /now/ correspond approximately 
m meaning to English 'this is because...' constructions, e.g. 

'and this is because I got 
some money' 

mikmyatu wondxmmu lzzih sil9m9TTa 'this is because his brother 

now. came here ' 

The form consisting of the affix /b(9)-/ prefixed to an infinitive form 
with a noun suffix pronoun may be used almost interchangeably with the 
/sil(9)-/ constructions. 

Thus, for example, the above sentences may be: 

mikniyatum gonz9b b9magngte n9w. 



mikniyatu W9ndimmu lzzih b9m9mTatu 
n9W. 



'and this is because I got 
some money' 

'This is because his brother 
came here '

'due to the fact that'... 



lelitu muKat kamahonu yatanassa

'The night was _so hot that I

The preposition /k(a)-/ is used m combination with the word /yatanassa/. 
The resulting construction corresponds m meaning to the English 'so... that' 
clauses . 

Examples: 



kamadkamu yatanassa lisara

kadikamu *^ yatanassa 

liyannagaggiran alcalem.

'He came early. '

UNIT 30 



The infinitives of these verbs are: 

/dess malet/ 
/keff ma let/ 
/Kedemm ma let/ 
/KuCC ma let/ 
/feTTenn malet/ 
/Toga ma let/ 
/barkett malet/

'to be important' 

'to be somewhat earlier' 

'to sit down' 

'to be quicker' 

'to be somewhat 'nearer' 

'to be larger ' 

'to be somewhat farther' 



The first part of these compound verbs may be: 

1) a derivative noun (not used independently as a menmgful word), e.g. 
/dess malet/ (/dessita/ 'pleasure') 

/keff malet/ (/keffita/ 'height') 



2) an onomatopoetic word (imitating the sound of an action), e.g. 
/waw malet/ 'to bark' 

/miyaw malet/ 'to mew' 

/imbwa malet/ 'to bellow' 

/u'u malet/ 'to call for help' 

etc. 



3) a noun derived from a verb, e.g. 

/raKK malet/ (/raKe-meraK/ 'to be far') 

/berkett malet/ (/berekkete-meberket/ 

'to increase ' ) 

/feTenn malet/ (/f eTTene-mefTen/ 'to be quick') 

etc. 

(This type of compound verb forms the inconclusive aspect of the 
corresponding simple verbs, described m Note 30.1.1).

parts are formed by substituting the verb /madreg/ for /ma lot/, e.g. 



/KuCC ma dreg/ 
/keff ma dreg/ 



'to seat, ' to cause to sit down' 
' to elevate ' 



The Gerund of the compound verbs with /ma let/ is often used adverbially, 



e.g. 



Kedemm bilo meTTa 
raKK bilo hede 
Toga bilo teKemmeTe 
KuCC bilo yibelal 



'He came earlier' 
'He went farther ' 
'He sat nearer ' 
'He eats sitting' 



The verb /dess malet/ 'to please' is an impersonal verb (see Note 20.2). 
The most used forms of this verb are: 



dess alen" 

dess aleh 

dess alew 
etc. 

dess bilon nebber 

dess bilohal 

dess bilotal 
etc. 

dess bilon nebber 

dess biloh nebber 

dess bilot nebber 
etc. 

dess yilennal 

dess yilihal 

dess yilewal 
etc. 



'I'm pleased/happy ( 'it pleases me ' ) ' 
'You're pleased/happy ('it pleases you')' 
'He's pleased/happy ('it pleases him') ' 

Present Perfect 

'I've been pleased/happy' 
'You've been pleased/happy' 
'He's pleased/happy' 

Past Perfective 

'I was pleased/happy' 
'You were pleased/happy' 
'He was pleased/happy' 

Imperfective 

'I'll be pleased/happy ' 
'You'll be pleased/happy' 
'He'll be pleased/happy'

Note that both the Present and the Present Perfect tenses may be used 
as equivalents to English 'I'm happy, you're happy,' etc. or 'I'm pleased, 
you're pleased', etc. 

Note 30.1.1. Verb* Inconclusive Aspect 

The inconclusive aspect describes the action or the state 
of the verb as not entirely completed or as being of a very short duration. 
It may describe an action which is not completely finished or is not thoroughly 
performed or a state which is of a somewhat incomplete character, such as 
'somewhat sad,' 'somewhat thirsty,' 'somewhat farther', 'pretty near', etc. 

Examples: _ _ . , 

Inconclusive Aspect 

gebba 'he entered' goba ale 'he came m for a very 

short time ' 

azzeno 'he was sad' azonn ale 'he was somewhat sad' 

fellGge 'he looked for' falegg adorrogs 'he looked for (not 

very tnoroughly) ' 

As a general rule the transitive verbs form the Inconclusive Aspect with 
/madreg/ and the intransitive verbs with /malst/, e.g. 

Inconclusive Aspect 

momTat 'to come' moTa ma let 'to drop m for a while' 

mosTot 'to give' seTott madrog 'to give reluctantly' 

or 

'to give a small amount' 

The first parts of these compound verbs (i.e. the verbal nouns) are 
formed as follows 1 the distribution of vowels m three-and two-radical verbs 
is the same as m the perfective. 

l) Three-Radical Verbs. 

The last radical is always long. The second radical of Type A verbs is 
always short, and that of Type B verbs is usually short, but may be long.

noggoro nogorr 

Type B fsllege folegg 
molleso molloss

Grammatical Notes 

Note 31.1 /bo- . . . bokkul/ ' m the direction of 'as far as one is concerned' 

a to yohannisim bobokkulu sirawm 'As for Mr. John, having finished 

Gorriso laguzow tozogajje. his job he was ready for the 

trip ' . 

The preposition /b(o)-/ combined with the postposition /bokkul/ may be 
used interchangeably with the preposition /bostto)-/ (Note if. 6.1). Thus 
/bostomisraK/ 'to the North' may be said /bomisraK bokkul/j /bostodobub/ 'to 
the South', /bodsbub bokkul/, etc. 



UNIT 11 



The form /bebekkul-/ used with the noun suffix pronouns means 'as far 
as one is concerned', 'as for', e.g. 



babakkule yarsiwon hassab 
lKKobbolallohu. 

babakkulaccew timihirtaccewm 

Carnsaw wodageraccaw tamallssu. 



'As far as I am concerned I agree 
with your idea. ' 

'As for them, they completed their 
studies and returned to their 
country. ' 



Note 31.2 The use of /bicca/ 'only' with Noun Suffix Pronouns and the direct 
object suffix /-(i)n/, equivalent to English 'alone', 'by one- 
self. 



tinnis raKK bilo biccawin 
ymoral. 



'He lives alone not very far 
from here. ' 



When the word /bicca/ 'only' is used with noun suffix pronouns and the 
direct object suffix /(i)n/ (Note 1|..5>), the resulting construction corresponds 
to English 'alone' or 'by myself', 'by himself' etc.: 



biccayen 

biccahm 

biccasm 

biccawin 

biccawan 

biccaccimn 

biccaccihun 

biccaccowm 



Examples: 



biccayen morallshu. 

biccawan wodaddis aboba hedge. 

menna balabete biccaccimn 
misaccmm ballan. 



'I alone ' 
'you(m) alone ' 
'you(f) alone' 
'he alone ' 
'she alone ' 
'we alone ' 
'you (pi. ) alone 1 
'they alone ' 

'I live alone 1 . 

'She went to Addis alone'. 

'My wife and I dined alone '

Grammatical Notes 



Note 32.1 Suffix /-ge/. 

kalgaw girge asKommiTow. Place it at the foot of the bed. 

The suffix /-ge/ is affixed to nouns denoting parts of the human body 
to form new nouns connected m meaning with these parts, e.g. 

/lgir/ 'foot' /girge/ 'bottom part' 

/ras/ 'head' /rasge/ 'upper part' 

/ijj/ 'hand, arm' /ljjige/ 'sleeve' 

/w8g9b/ 'waist' /wQgebge/ 'waist line' 



Note 32.2 Verb: /mdghonU)/ used with /y(e)-/ and /ysramd)-/ relative 
forms, 'if', ' m case'. 

mmalbat wodaddis abgba biKK 'If ever you happen to come 

yemmittil mdohon, adrassaccm ('appear') to Addis, our 

amerikan embassi now. address is the American 

Embassy. 

The form /md9hon(e)/ may be translated 'if it be'. The imperfective 
relative, used with this form, indicates a possible situation, or one which 
may occur m the future. The perfective relative, used with this form, 
refers to a definite act, having the 'completed' or 'considered completed' 
meaning characteristic of the perfective aspect. 



352 



BASIC COURSE 



UNIT 3 2 



Compare the following imperfective relative sentences with the corre- 
sponding perfective ones: 



Imperf ective 

yemmithed mdohon, nigoron. 
'Tell -me if you're going' 
( ' if it be that you are the 
one who is going'). 

wodokotoma yammithed mdohon, Tiran. 
'If you go downtown, call me'. 
( 'if it be that you are the one 
who will be going') 



Perfective 

yohedk mdohon nigoron. 
'Tell me m case you go' 
( ' if it be that you are 

the one who will have 

gone ' ) . 

wodokotoma yohedk mdohon, Tiran. 
'Call me m case you go downtown' 
( 'if it be that you are the one 
who will have gone ' ) 



As illustrated by the above examples the /mdohon/ clauses may correspond 
approximately to English 'if, or ' m case' clauses. 

... i: ^ 

Other examples: 

1) yommimsTa mdohon astawKon. 
yomoTTa mdohon astawKon. 



2) 
3) 

k) 



yommittittammGm mdohon wode 
hakim hid. 

yotammomk mdohon wod© hakim 
hid. 



'If he comes, let me know. ' 

'Let me know m case he comes. ' 

'If you get ill go to see a 
doctor. ' 

'In case you get ill go and see 
a doctor. ' 



The /yommd)-/ relative clauses with /mdohon/ may be used more or less 
interchangeably with the conditional forms m /b(i)-/ and /k(e)-/ described 
m Notes llj.,3 and 15.5.1 

Thus, for example, /yommimoTa mdohon astawKon/ may be said /bimoTa 
astawKon/ or /komoTTa astawKon/ without any significant change m the meaning. 



Note 32.3 /mdohon(o)/ used with the Short Imperfective and Gerund 'whether 
(or not) ' . 

/mdohon(o)/ may be also used with the Short Imperfective or the 
Gerund. The resulting clauses correspond m meaning to English 'whether or 
not' clauses. /mdohon(o)/ with a Short Imperfective refers to a present or 
future situation, and with a Gerund to a past situation, e.g. 

nege yimoTa mdohon nigoron. 'Tell me whether he '11 come 

tomorrow. ' 

tmantmna motTo mdohon, nigoron. 'Tell me whether he came 

yesterday. •

UNIT 32 



AMHARIC 



Note 32. l\. Verb: Infinitive with Noun Suffix Pronouns used with verb 
forms /now/ and /nobbor/ 

kezzih yemmibis gize alio 'Do you mean to say that the 

maletih now t weather will be worse? ' 

The verb forms /now/ 'is', or /nobbor(e)/ 'was' may be affixed to an 
Infinitive plus a noun suffix pronoun. 

The resulting forms ('one's doing so-and-so is' or 'one's doing so-and-so 
was') are used to indicate what one is/was doing (cr is/was about to do) at 
that precise moment, and corresponds approximately to the English 'just doing 
so-and-so' or 'just about to do so-and-so', e.g. 

/moblate now/ 'I'm just eating' ' 

(or: 'I'm just about to eat') 

/mehedu nobbor/ '(At that moment) he was going' 

( or : 'he was just about to go') 

These forms are often used m situations m which one describes what he 
is (or was) about to do when interrupted, e.g. 

rat moblataccm now. 'Oh, we 're just eating (about 

to eat) dinner. ' 

irsiwo simoTu me mehede nebber. 'When you came, I was just about 

to leave . ' 

In some situations the form with /nobbor/ may indicate what one meant 
or was intending to do, e.g. 

astemarlw lsklmoTa mastomare 'I just meant to teach until 

nobbor. the teacher came. 

When used m negative, these forms may correspond approximately to 
English: 'unless this is so-and-so, then it will mean my (his, your, etc.) 
doing so-and-so' or: 'had it not been so-and-so, then it would have meant 
my (his, your, etc.) doing so-and-so', e.g. 

bohulott seat kalmoTTah, 'Unless you come at two it will 

wedebete mehede now. mean my going home. ' 

bosoatu batmeTa noro, misaccimn 'Had you not come m time, it 

moblataccm nobbor. would have meant our eating 

the lunch. '

Grammatical Notes 

Note 33.1 Verb: /s-/ Negative combined with the forms of the verb /Karra- 
maKrat/ 'to remain'. 

awon, sayasfalliguwot ayKarum. 'Yes you may probably, need them. ' 

Negative /s-/ constructions (see Note 12,6) are used m combination with 
the forms of the verb /maKrat/. 

The approximate English equivalents of the resulting constructions may 
be illustrated by the following examples: 

1) /s-/ Negative used with Affirmative forms of /maKrat/: 

saymaTa yiKaral 'he may not come (despite the fact 

that he is supposed to do so) ' 

saymaTa Karra 'he didn't come (despite the fact 

that he was supposed to do so) ' 

2) /s-/ Negative used with negative forms of /maKrat/ 

saymaTa ayKarim 'he will probably come ' 

saymaTa alKarrem 'he might have come ' 

As shown by the above examples the affirmative forms of the verb /maKrat/ 
m these contructions indicate that the action of the /s-/ verb may not take 
place (imperfective) or did not take place (Perfective) contrary to one's 
expectations, whereas the negative forms of the same verb imply that the 
action of the /s-/ verb will probably take place (imperfective) or might have 
taken place (Perfective). 

The complete set of these forms is: 

salmaTa lKarallahu 'I may not come ' 

satmaTa tiKarallah 'You may not come ' 

satmaCi tiKariyallas 'You if) may not come' 

saymaTa yiKaral 'He may not come '

Grammatical Notes 

Note 34.1 Verb: Frequentative form. 

The Frequentative Form usually indicates a fracturing of the 
process of the action or state of the verb or gives a reiterative character 
to the verb. 

Examples: 









Freque 


ntative Form 


/mangar/ 


'to 


tell' 


/managagar/ 


'to 


tell bit by bit' 


/msf 9ll8g/

/malayyat/ 


'to

/malayayat/ 


'to

/mamanzar/ 


'to

/mamanazazar/

/mazwazwar/ 


'to 


circulate ' 


/mosoT/ 


'to

/ma sasaT/ 


'to 


sell now and then' 



As can be seen from the above examples, the frequentative verbs have 
only one single type, e.g. 

Simple Form Frequentative Form 

Type A /mangar/ /managagar/ 

Type B /mafallag/ /mafalalag/ 

The penultimate consonant is reduplicated. The reduplication is a single 
consonant plus /a/. The two-radical verbs of the class /mahon/ have an addi- 
tional /w/ before the /a/, e.g. /mazor/ - /mazwazwar/, /maKom/ - /maKwaKwam/. 

Where the penultimate consonant of the simple form is preceded by another 
consonant, the frequentative form has an /a/ preceding the reduplicated con- 
sonant, as m /mangar/ - /managagar/ or /mamrat/ - /mamararat/, etc.

Are the American and the Ethiopian 
parties similar? 

He likes to share his ideas with 
others . 

When my brother was leaving for 
America, he went to say goodbye 
to our father. 

Mr. Kebbede and Mr. John, having 
said goodbye to each other, 
left for their respective 
countries. 

What did Mr. Kebbede discuss 
with Mr. John before he left? 

Now let's discuss (about the) 
prices. 

We shared the food. 



The above examples illustrate the use of the reciprocal verbs. The 
reciprocal verbs may have two forms: a simple reciprocal form (e.g. 
/m9ffal9g/) and a reduplicated one (e.g. /meffelalGg/) . The simple reciprocal 
verbs have an /-a-/ following the first radical of three- and two- radical 
passive verbs, e.g. 



3-rad : 
2-rad: 



/meffeleg/ 
/m9mm9rat/ 



Simple Reciprocal 

/meffaleg/ 
/mgmmarat/ 



The four-radical reciprocal verbs have an /-a-/ following the second 
radical of the corresponding Passive verb, e.g. 



Passive 



/m9mm9nz9r/ 



Reciprocal 
/m9mm9naz9r/ 



The reduplicated reciprocal verb is the passive form of the frequentative 
verb, e.g. 



369 



UNIT 3k AMHARIC 



Frequentative Reduplicated Reciprocal 

3-rad* /mgf slaleg/ /mof f olalog/ 

2-rad: /memerarat/ /msmmsrarat/ 

rad: /msmonezazer/ /mGmmonezazer/ 

Here are some examples of the Reciprocal Verbs t 

Basic Form Simple Reciprocal Reduplicated Reciprocal 

/mofollGg/ /m9ffal9g/ /m9ff9lal9g/ 

'to look for' 'to look for each 'to look for each other 

other' repeatedly' 

/m9kf9l/ /mgkkafgl/ /m9kk9faf9l/ 

'to divide' 'to share' 'to be divided among 

several persons ' 

/mswdod/ /mewwaded/ 

'to like' 'to like each other' 

/magnet/ / meggsnanst / 

'to find' < 'to meet' 

/m9ng9r/ /m9nnag9r/ /m9nn9gag9r/ 

'to tell' 'to talk' 'to discuss' 

/m9m9nz9r/ /m9mm9naz9r/ /m9mm9n9zaz9r/ 

'to change' 'to exchange' 'to exchange repeatedly' 

/m9wK9s/ /m9wwaK9s/ /m9ww9KaK9s/ 

'to reprove ' 'to reprove each 'to reprove each other 

other' repeatedly' 

/m9S9nb9t/ /m93S9nab9t/ /m9ss9n9bab9t/ 

'to spend a few 'to bid goodbye' 'to bid goodbye to each 

days ' other ' 



As seen from the above examples the simple and the reduplicated forms of 
the reciprocal verbs may have the same meaning. They are, therefore, sometimes 
used interchangeably by the speakers of Amharic. The reduplicated form, 
however, may imply that either the action of the verb is performed repeatedly 
or that more than two persons are involved m the performance of their action. 

Sometimes only one of the two forms is used (e.g. /mowwaded/, or 
/m9gg9nann9t/) . Sometimes the meaning of the two forms is clearly different, 



370 



BASIC COURSE 



UNIT 3k 



e.g. /tanaggere/ 'he talked', /tanagaggara/ 'he discussed', /tagabbu/ 'they 
got married', /tagababbu/ 'they understood each other'. 

It should be noted that where the meaning is clearly reciprocal the 
plural forms only are used, as m /taf alallagu/ 'they looked for each other' 
or m /innif f alallagallan/ 'we are looking for each other', etc. 

Where, however, the meaning of reciprocity has been lost and the verb 
implies simply that more than one person is involved, the singular forms are 
equally used as m /tanaggara/ 'he talked'; /tasanabbata/ 'he bade goodbye'. 

As shown by Chart IX, reciprocal verbs have only one pattern with regard 
to the distribution of vowels and consonants, thus /mannagar/ (from /mangar/- 
Type A) and /maffalag/ from /mafallag/ - Type B) are of the same type.

Mary had mercy upon 
you'). (Said to a woman 
who had a now baby) . 



Note 35.2. The use of /mkwan/ m combination with /yiKrmna/ 'let it be 
left 1 as equivalent to English 'let alone'... 'whether... or 
not', 'even though', etc. 

In addition to the usage described m Note 35*1 above, /mkwan/ may 
also be used m combination with the Jussive form of the verb /moKrat/ plus 
suffix /-(i)nna/ 'and'. The resulting constructions correspond approximately 
to English 'let alone', 'whether... or not', 'even though' clauses. 

It should be noted that the form /yiKrmna/ may or may not be used. 



Examples: 

mkwan gonzob liyabeddinh (yiKrmna) 
allonnim aylih. 

mkwan lotomariwoc, lastomariwoc 
als9TTam. 

mkwan wiski yiKrmna woynim 
ayToTTam. 

mkwan lewedajoccu yiKrmna, 
loTelatoccum cor now. 

mkwan bokromt, bebogam lomohed 
yascoggiral. 



'He will not even admit ('tell 
you') that he has money, let 
alone lending you some'. 

'He didn't even give it to the 
teachers let alone the 
students. ' 

'He doesn't even drink wme, 
let alone whisky. ' 

'He's even generous to his 
enemies, let alone his friends. 

'It's even hard to get there m 
summer, let alone m winter. ' 



In expressions corresponding roughly to the English 'whether... or not' 
clauses /mkwan/ is usually combined with the verb used both m the affirm- 
ative gerund and the negative /b(i)-/ forms, e.g. 



mkwan tomiro yiKrmna, bayimmarim 
mkwan astoway now. 

mkwan gonzeb agnito, bayagannim 
mdohabtam manor yiwQddal. 



'He is [naturally] intelligent, 
whether he is educated or not'. 

'He likes to live like a rich 
man, whether he's got money 
or not ' .

Grammatical Notes 

Note 37.1 Verb: The use of the verb /mawsK/ 'to know' with the Gerund as 

equivalents to English 'have ever done (or: been) so-and- 
so' and 'have never done (or: been) so-and-so'. 



berodo avtew yawKallu t 
yQllQm, lskahun dirgs borodo 
ayicce alawKim. 



'Have you ever seen snow? ' 

'No, I've never seen snow until 
now. 



The Imperfective of the verb /mawoK/ 'to know' is used m combination 
with the Gerund of another verb m questions equivalent to English 'have you 
(I, he, she, etc.) ever done (or: been) so-and-so' (the latter indicated by 
the gerund) . The person involved in the action or state of the verb is 
indicated both by the Gerund and the Imperfective personal affixes to /mawoK/. 
The same construction occurs with the Negative Imperfective of the verb 
/mawoK/ m statements or questions equivalent to English 'you (i, he, she, 
etc.) have never (or: haven't you, etc. ever) done (or: been) so-and-so'. 



Examples : 



fslligge awKallohu t 
'have I ever wanted? ' 

felligGh tawKalloh t 

'have you (m) ever wanted? ' 

fGlliges tawKiyalles t 

'have you (f ) ever wanted? ' 

felligo yawKal t

felliga tawKalloc t 

'has she ever wanted? ' 



felligge alawKim. 

'I have never wanted' 

folligeh attawKim. 

'you (m) have never wanted' 

folligos attawKim. 

'you (f) have never wanted' 

felligo ayawKim. 

'he has never wanted'

UNIT 37 



AMHARIC 



The interrogative of the second column would be /folligge alawKim t /, 
etc. 'haven't I ever wanted', etc. The affirmative of the first column 
would be /folligge awKallohu/, /folligoh tawKalleh/, etc. 'I have once 
wanted', etc. This form may sometimes occur m the answers to the questions, 
e.g. 



Question 



Answer 



gonzob agnitoh tawKalleh t 

'Have you ever got any money? ' 

boniwyork wisT noreh tawKalloh t 
'Have you ever lived m New 
York? 



and gize agnicce awKallohu. 
I got it only once. ' 

norre awKallohu. 

[Yes] I have (lived onece) 



Various relational affixes may be prefixed to the Short Imperfective or 
Perfective (where this is required by the construction) of the verb /mawoK/ 
as equivalents to such English expressions as 'that you have ever done' 
/serteh yommittawK/, 'because I have never heard' /semmicce silommalawK/, 
'if you have never eaten' /beltoh kalawweKh/, etc.

Grammatical Notes 

Note 41.1 Postpositions: The use of /zand/ or /ga/ as a postposition with 

or without relational affixes. 

baityoPiyawian zand sijara maCas Smoking cigarettes is not customary 

yatalammada aydallam. among the Ethiopians. 

irsiwo zand lunaTa alcalhum. I couldn't come to [see] you. 

The postpositions /zand/ or /ga/ are used interchangeably by the 
speakers of Amharic. While /ga/ is used commonly in spoken Amharic, 
particularly in Addis, /zand/ is used elsewhere, as well as in more 
formal speech and in written Amharic. It should be noted, however, that 
/zand/ is used more often with reference to persons while /ga/ usually 
refers to objects or places. 



420 



BASIC COURSE 



UNIT 41 



The meaning of these postpositions varies according to the context 
and the relational affixes which may be prefixes to the word they modify. 

Note 41.1.1 /ka- . . . zend-ga/ 'from 1 

The postposition /zand/ or /ga/ may be in combination with the 
relational affix /ka-/ (or /ta-/ in some dialects) 'from 1 , e.g. 

kakabbada ga (or: zand) 'I've got a letter from Kebbede'. 

dabdabbe darrasan. 

Note 41.1.2 /i- ...zand~ga/ 'with', 'at', 'by' 

The postpositions /zand/ or /ga/ combined with the relational affix 
/i-/ mean 'with', 'by', 'at', /zand/ or /ga/ alone may also be used in 
this meaning. For example: 

ine zand ( or: ga) yinoral. He lives with me. 

iTaraPezaw ga nabbar. It was by the table. 

ibabur Tabiyaw ga agannahut. I met him at the station. 

Note 41.1.3 /ba- ...zand/ 'among' 

Used with the relational affix /ba-/ the postposition /zand/ means 
'among'. (/ga/ is not used in combination with this affix, and some 
speakers would prefer the use of /makakkal/ 'among' instead of /zand/.) e.g. 

basawoc zand liyyu liyyu There are many various customs 

limadocc allu. among the people. 

Note 41.1.4 /zand~ga/ 'to' 

The postpositions /zand/ or /ga/ may be used instead of /wada-/ 
•to 1 with verbs of motion when they refer to a person (not a place), e.g. 

naga lemma ga (or: zand) I'm going to [see] Lemma tomorrow, 

lhedallahu. 

but: 

wadasinima inhedallan. We're going to the movies.

Note 41.1.5 /izzlh zand~izzih ga/ 'over here' and /izziya zand- izziya ga/ 
'over there ' . 

Used with /izzlh/ 'here' and /izziya/ 'there' these postpositions 
mean 'over here' and 'over there ' , respectively, e.g. 

izzlh ga (or: zand) asKammiTaw. Put it over here. 

izziya ga (or: zand) asKammiTaw . Put it over there. 

Note 41.2 Verb: The use of /zand/ as a postverb. 
Note 41.2.1 /zand/ with Short Imperf ective . 

lrdatawon yadargulliri zand ('I beg that you assist me.') 

llamminallahu. 

The Postverb /zand/ is used with the Short Imperf ective to mean 
'so that', 'that', 'in order to', e.g. 

yifallig zand 'so that he may look for' 

yinegr zand 'so that he may tell' 

Note 41.2.2 /ka ...zand/ with Perfective 

The Postverb /zand/ may be used with the Perfective in combination 
with the relational affix /ka-/- The resulting form corresponds approxi- 
mately to the English 'due to the fact that', 'since', e.g. 

kamaTTahu zand and TiyyaKe Since I've come I'd like to ask 

liTayyiKih if alligallahu. you a question. 

Note 41.3 The use of the form /kanoran/, /kanorah/, etc. in equivalent to 
English 'If I do have', 'if you do have', etc. 

The affix /k(a)-/ may be prefixed to the perfective form of the 
verb /manor/ 'to exist'. The resulting form with the verb suffix pronouns 
is used almost interchangeably with the form /kalian/, /kallah/, etc. 
'if I do have', if you do have', etc. which was discussed in Note 15.5.I, 
e.g. 

ganzab kanoran wade sinimabet If I do have money I'll go to 

lhedaliohu. the movies. 

maSihafu kanorah siTari. If you do have the book, give it 

to me.

BASIC COURSE 



UNIT 4l 



The negative form of this construction is: 

kalnoran If I don't have 

kalnorah If you don't have 

etc. 

Note 41.4 The verb /manor/ 'to exist 1 used impersonally as an equivalent 
to English 'will have 1 and 'may have'. 

Impersonal verbs were discussed in Note 20.2 

The Imperfective Impersonal form of the verb /manor/ 'to exist' 
corresponds in meaning to English 'I'll have', 'you'll have', etc. 

/yinorannal/ 'I'll have' /aynorannim/ r I won't have' 

/ymonhal/ 'you'll have' /aynorihun/ 'you won't have' 

etc. etc. 

/ymoran yihonal/, /yinorih yihonal/, etc., means 'I may have', 'you may 
have', etc. and /aynoran yihonal/, /aynonh yihonal/, etc. - 'I may not 
have', 'you may not have', etc. and /ymoribbinnal/, /yinonbbihal/ etc. - 
'I'll have to', 'you'll have to', etc. Examples: 

yammimaTaw amat bet ymorannal. 'I'll have a house next year.' 

yammimaTaw amat bet yinoran 'I may have a house next year', 

yihonal . 

It should be noted, however, that a more definite idea of 
'possession' is usually expressed by the verb /magnat/ 'to find', 'to get', 
rather than by the impersonal form of the verb /manor/, e.g., 

naga ganzab agannallahu. 'I'll have (or: get) money 

tomorrow . 

ganzab kagannahu larsiwo 'If I have (or: get) money, I'll 

isaTiwotallahu. give it to you'.

Grammatical Notes 
Note 42.1 Verb: Progressive Form 

gana bamallamed lay nan. I am still in the process of 

getting used [to it]. 

The infinitive with the prefix /ba-/ and followed by /lay/ "on* 
is used to describe an action in the process of being performed or a state 
in the process of undergoing a change. 

The present progressive is formed using the above plus the verb 
forms /-nan/, /-nah/, /-naw/, etc. * I am 1 , *you are 1 , *he is 1 , etc., or 
their negative counterparts /aydallahum/, /aydallahim/, /aydallam/, etc. 
*I am not*, lyou are not 1 , *he is not*, etc. e.g. 

/bamahed lay nah/ *I am in the process of going. * 

/bemahed lay aydallahum/ *I am not in the process of going. 1 

The past progressive is formed by adding the verb forms /nabbarhu/, 
/nabbarh/, /nabbar(a)/, etc. "I was 1 , *you were*, *he was', etc. or their 
negative counterparts /alnabbarhum/, /alnabbarhzun/, /alnabbaram/, ! I was 
not 1 , ! you were not 1 , *he was not 1 , e.g. 

/bamahed lay nabbarhu/ *I was in the process of going*. 

/bamahed lay alnabbarhum/ *I was not in the process of going. 1 

The past progressive may also be formed by adding /nabbar-/ (or /alnabbar-/) 
verb forms to the /s(i)-/ contructions (Note 12.6). The personal endings 
of the verb /nabbar-/ are optional, e.g. 

sihed nabbarku. or: sihed nabbar. *I was in the process of going f . 

sihed alnabbarkum. or : sihed f I was not in the process of going 1 , 

alnabbaram. 

The /ba- ...lay nabbar-/ and /s ( i) -.. .nabbar-/ constructions are used 
more or less interchangeably.

BASIC COURSE 



UNIT 42 



Note 42.2 Verb: 'whether ...(or not)* constructions. 

These constructions involve the use of the Affirmative and the 
Negative Infinitive with Possessive Suffix Pronouns and the Specific direct 
object suffix in constructions which are equivalent to English 'whether... 
(or not) 1 constructions. 

legiddibu 'yataKKadaw bota baTam I don't know whether the proposed 

tasmami mahonuninna alamahonun site will be suitable for a 

alawKim. dam (or not). 

The 'whether ...or not' constructions may be formed in Amharic by 
use of both the affirmative and negative infinitive forms with the appro- 
priate possessive (noun) suffix pronouns, set in apposition or linked by 
the conjunctions /-(i)nna/ 'and' or /wayim/ 'or'. These constructions may 
have the following variants : 

l) The two infinitives may be in apposition to each other, the 
possessive suffix pronoun and the specific direct object suffix being 
affixed to the negative infinitive only, e.g. 



/madrag alemadregen alnegrihun./ I'm not going to tell you whether 



2) The Infinitive forms may be connected by the conjunction /weyun/ 
'or', with suffixes affixed to both forms, e.g. 



3) The infinitive forms may be connected by the conjunction 
/-(i)nna/ 'and' with suffixes affixed to both forms, e.g. 



4) The infinitive forms may be connected by the conjunction 
/-(i)nna/ with suffixes affixed to the negative infinitive form only, e.g. 



I'll do it (or not). ('the 
my doing not doing') 



/madregen wayim alemadregen 
alnegrihun./ 



I'm not going to tell you whether 
I'll do it (or not) . ( 'the 
my doing or the my not doing') 



/madregeninna alemadregen

I'm not going to tell you whether 
I'll do it (or not). ('the 
my doing and the my not doing') 



/madragmna alamadragen

expressions corresponding approximately to English 'so-so', 'fair to 
middling,' etc.

As illustrated by the above examples the Benefactive verbs have 
two forms , simple and reduplicated. The reduplication is the same as that 
of the reciprocal verbs. 

The general meaning of the Benefactive or Causative-Reciprocal verbs 
is either 'to help to perform the action of the verb 1 or 'to cause that 
action to be performed mutually. 1 

The simple and the reduplicated forms may have the same meaning and 
may be used interchangeably, according to local preference, e.g. /maffalag/ 
and /maffelalag/ 'to help to look for', /mawwasad/ and /mawwasasad/ 'to 
help to carry'. 

Sometimes the meanings of these two forms may be slightly different. 
The reduplicated forms may imply a repeated action or may indicate that 
more than two persons are involved in the performance of the action of the verb. 



445 



UNIT 43 



AMHARIC 



Finally, the meaning of the two forms may be completely different 
(see examples below). 

With some verbs the 'benefactive' or 1 causative-reciprocal 1 meaning 
has been lost, e.g. /marragagaT/ 'to assure 1 . 

Some verbs have only one such form. This form may be the simple one 
as in /mawwadad/ 'to cause to like each other 1 , or the reduplicated one as 
in /maggabayayat/ 'to help to shop'. The /a-/ verbs have benef active forms 
in /as-/, e.g. /astawwaKa - mastawaK - yastawwiKal/ 'to inform' ('to cause 
to be known') from /tawwaka - mattawaK - yittawwaKal/ the passive form of 
/awwaKa - mawaK - yawKal/. 

The Benefactive verbs may be said to be causatives of the passive 

forms . 

Here are some other examples of the Benefactive verbs : 



Basic form : 

/makfal/ 
'to divide' 

/malbas/ 
'to dress' 

/maTayyaK/ 
•to ask' 
/malamman/ 
•to beg' 
/maKuraT/ 
•to cut' 



Benefactive form : 

Simple. 

/makkaf al/ 

'to divide between 
two persons' 

/mallabas/ 

'to help somebody 
dress someone 1 



/mallaman/ 

'to help to beg' 

/maKKwaraT/ 

'to cause to stop' 
'to cross' 



Reduplicated. 

/makkaf af a 1/ 

•to divide among 
several persons' 

/mallababas/ 

'to cause several people 
to dress each other' 

/maTTayayaK/ 

'to cause to inquire' 

/mallamaman/ 

'to help to beg' 

/maKKoraraT/ 

•to cause to cut' 



Chart X shows the distribution of vowels and consonants of the following 
Benefactive verbs in their various forms : 

1) /maffalag/ and /maffalalag/ 'to help to look for'. 

2) /mammarat/ and /mammararat/ 'to cause to lead each other'. 

3) /mammanazar/ and /mammanazazar/ 'to help to change money'.

Grammatical Notes 



Note 45.1 The use of /bicca sayhon/ in expressions equivalent to English 
'not only .... but also constructions. 



maggodat bicca sayhon, mamotim 
yicilallu. 



They may be not only wounded but 
also killed ( 'die') . 



The equivalent to English 'not only . . . but also ...» constructions 
is rendered in Amharic by the phrase /bicca sayhon/ 'only unless it 
becomes' and the suffix /-(i)m/ 'and 1 , affixed to the word so emphasized. 
The word with the suffix /-(i)m/ may or may not be followed by the word 
/Curanir/ 'including'. 



Examples : 

issu bicca sayhon mem Cimmir 

lhedallahu. 
bi'ir bicca sayhon maSihafim 

Cimmir lamagzat if alligallahu. 
mablat bicca sayhon maTaTTatim

UNIT 45 



Note 45.2 Adverblals . 

Note 45.2.1 Adverblals in /b(a)/. 

A great number of adverblals in Amharic are formed by prefixing the 
affix /b(a)/ to various words. 

Following are some of such adverblals which have already occurred 
in the previous units : 



baKann 


to the right 


bagra 


to the left 


befit 


before 


bamalla 


entirely 


bawmatu 


really 


bahwala 


afterwards 


band inns t 


together 


baCirraS 


completely 


badmgst 


suddenly 


bsKsTTita 


directly 


bsdsnb 


properly 



Note 45.2.2 Adverblals of time in /-(i)n/. 

ysbanku ssrratsnnoc Ksnun bsmulu The bank employees are working 

yisarallu. all day long. 

The direct object suffix /-(i)n/ is affixed to nouns denoting time, 
such as 'day', 'night 1 , 'week 1 , 'year', 'summer', 'winter', etc. The 
resulting forms correspond to English adverbial phrases 'all day long', 
'during the whole night', 'all the summer', etc. The form in /-(i)n/ is 
often used in combination with the words /bsmulu/ or /bams 11 a/ 'completely', 
'entirely', 'fully'. Examples: 

Kanun isarallahu. 'I work all day long'. 

lelitun aTanallahu. 'I study all the night'. 

sammintun bsmulu ssrru. 'They worked during the whole week' 

bsgawin tsguzo agsru darrasa. 'He came home after having 

travelled all the summer.' 



461 



UNIT 45 



amatun bamulu izzih*nora. 
saatun bemulu abran taKammeTin. 



'He lived here all year long 1 . 

'We sat together for the whole hour*. 



lelltun tenna. 

kiramtun bamalla sarrahu. 



'He slept all night long*. 
'I worked all the winter*. 



The same suffix /-(i)n/ may be affixed to nouns to form the adverbials 
of manner, e.g. 

ine mengaden hedku, issum 'I went my way and he went his 

mangedun heda. way 1 . 

raKutun tarina. 'He slept naked 1 . 
(raKut - naked) 

The adverbial phrase /lgra mengaden/., /lgra mengedhm/, etc. is used as an 

equivalent to English 'on my way 1 , 'on his way 1 etc., e.g. 

lgra mengaden irsiwo bet '1*11 come to your house on my 

imaTallahu. way', 

lgra mengadaccawm addis ababa 'He stopped in Addis on his 

darsew meTTu. way back', 

wedaharar sihed lgra mangadun 'He visited his mother on his 

innatun TayyaKa. way to Harar'. 



Note 45.2.3 Gerund forms used adverbially. 



awKo kalgaddalaw beKer, bafirdbet 

ayikkassasim. 
Kadarn bilo maTTa. 



'If he doesn't kill intentionally 

he will not be brought to court*. 
'He came early*. 



In Note 30.1 the adverbial use of gerund (in particular the gerund 
form of the compound verbs with /malat/) was briefly discussed. 

The gerund forms are commonly used in this sense. Most of the time 
these adverbials correspond in meaning to the English adverbs in -ly . 



Examples : 

awKo 
Kedmo 
tedessito 
assibo 
azno 
etc . 



knowingly 

formerly 

happily 

deliberately 

sadly 



/mawaK/ 
/maKdem/ 
/maddeset/ 
/mas sab/ 
/mazan/ 



'to know* 
'to precede' 
'to be happy' 
'to think' 
'to be sad' 



462 



BASIC COURSE 



UNIT 45 



and the compound verbs with /malat/ (or: with /madrag/ for transitive verbs - 
see Note 30.1.1) : 





early 


raKK bilo 


far 


Karabb bilo 


near 


zigg bilo 


late 


faTann bilo 


fast 


weTa. bilo 


outside 


etc . 





One should bear in mind that gerund forms in Amharic are Inflected for 
person, gender and number (Note 11.2).

Grammatical Notes 

Note 46.1 The prefix /k(a)-/ 'from' used in combination with /wadih/ 

(or /wadazzih/) * towards here* and /wadiya/ (or /wadazziya/) 
'towards there*. 

The prefix /k(a)/ is used in combination with the words /wadih/ and 
/wadiya/. The resulting constructions mean 'this side* (/k(a)/-. . .wadih/) 
and 'that side* (/k(a)-. . .wadiya/) when used in connection with space, e.g. 



kazzih wanz wadih bizu zafocc 
allu. 

kamangadu wadiya and Konjo bet 
alia. 



'There are many trees on this 

side of the river'. 
'There is a pretty house across 

('that side') the street'. 



When used in connection with time the same constructions may mean 'since' 
and 'after' respectively. 



kand sammmt wadih alagannahutim. 

kand sammint wadiya agarinawallahu. 
lhedallahu kala wadiya, Karra. 
attibla biyye kanaggarhuh wadih 
lamin ballah. 



I haven't seen ('met') him since 

[last] week. 
I'll meet him in ('after') a week. 
After saying 'I'll go', he stayed. 
Why did you eat after I told you 

not to (eat) . 



/wadiya/ is used also to denote superior quality of persons or things, e.g. 



kalmaz wadiya Konjo, man alia. 

kaniwyork wadiya rain katema 
yiggannal . 



Who can be prettier than Almaz 
('who is pretty beyond Almaz'). 

What other city can be as exciting 
as New York ( 'beyond New York 
what city can be found'). 



Note that /k(a)-. . .belay/ may be substituted for /k( a) -.. .wadiya/.

Grammatical Notes 

Note 48.1 The use of the /l(i)-/ form in combination with /sil/, /sittil/, 
/sil/, etc. 'while I'm saying 1 , iwhile you're saying*, 'while 
he's saying' etc. as equivalents to English 'while attempting, 
trying, intending to do so-and-so'. 

The Structure Sentences illustrate the use of the /s(i)-/ form 
(Note 13.1.1) in combination with /sil/, /sittil/ etc. 'while I'm saying', 
'while you're saying', etc. 

The resulting constructions correspond approximately in meaning to 
English clauses 'while attempting', 'while trying' or 'while intending' to 
do so-and-so. 

These constructions may sometimes be used interchangeably with the 
ones consisting of a first person singular or plural imperfective combined 
with /sil/, /sittil/, etc. 

Thus the first structure sentence may be: 
mCat isabrallahu sil, ljjen KorraThut. 

The second: 
dingayun anasallahu sittil jarbah tagodda t 

The third: 

sinimawm mnayall an sittilu mabratu Taffa t 
without changing the meaning. 

Note 48.2 Verb! Intensive Aspect. 

sibbirr yadargunnal. They break me completely, 

sibirbirr yammiyadargu awrewoc. The animals that tear [you] to 

pieces . 

In contrast to the Inconclusive aspect (Note 30.1.1) the Intensive 
aspect describes the action or the state of the verb as entirely completed. 
The verbs of the Intensive aspect are compound. The nominal part of these 
compound verbs is followed by the verb /madrag/ or /malat/ like that of 
the Inconclusive aspect, e.g. /sibbirr madrag/' to break completely'. 



483 



UNIT 48 



AMHARIC 



Some verbs may be used in a reduplicated intensive aspect. The 
nominal part of these compound verbs is a reduplicated form of the nominal 
part of the regular Intensive aspect, e.g. /sibirbirr madrag/ 'to break 
into pieces 1 . 

The distribution of consonants and vowels in the nominal part of the 
Intensive aspect compound verbs is shown in the following chart: 

Three-Radical Verbs

/sib lrbirr

( 'broke into

Four-Radical Verbs 
/manazzara/ /manzarr adarraga/ /muizirr adarraga/ 



'he changed' 'he changed money 
(money) partially' 



'he changed money 
completely' 



/minzirz irr 
adarraga/ 

'he changed all 
his money' 



/saTTa/ 
'he gave' 



Two-Radical Verbs 



/saTatt adarraga/ /siTTitt adarraga/ 



'he gave half- 
heartedly' 



'he gave entirely' 



/siTiTTitt 

adarraga/ 

'he spread 

thoroughly' 



The Intensive aspect is used less frequently than the Inconclusive one and 
some types of verbs are not used in this aspect at all. 

Note 48.3 Verb; Conative Aspect. 

The verbs in this aspect are compound verbs, the first part of which 
is the infinitive with the prefix /mda-/ 'as though', and the second part 
a form of the verb /madrag/ for transitive verbs, and /ma let/ for intransi- 
tive verbs, e.g. /mdamaf allag madrag/, /indamahed malat/. 

The verbs in the Conative Aspect denote an attempt or an intention 
on the part of the actor to perform the action of the verb while the action

itself does not actually take place. Thus /indemef allag aderrege/ means 'he 
looked as though he was going to look for*, and /indemehed ale/ ' he made an 
attempt to go* or 'it seemed that he was going to go 1 . 



Examples :

indemeKom bilo hede. 

indemehed bilo teKemmeTe.

I feel as though I was sick.

this matter?

This is not something that can 
be done in a hurry.

First we have to discuss it with 
the Chief of Protocol and 
reach a verbal agreement. Then 
we have to write an application 
and explain [the matter] in 
detail to the Minister of the 
Imperial Court.

It won't take much time, but as it

Grammatical Notes 

Note 50.1 Verb: Emphatic Suffix /-a/ 'well then', 'all right then', 
'O.K. then.' 

mals liTTababaKat 'Shall I expect a reply then.* 

An emphatic suffix /-a/ may be affixed to verb forms. The resulting 
forms correspond approximately to the English 'well then', 'all right 
then', 'O.K. then', 'indeed', 'certainly', etc. This suffix always coincides 
with a sharply rising pitch /t /. Verb forms ending in /-a/ do not have 
this suffix, the emphasis being shown by the rising pitch only. Verb 
forms ending in /-a/ have this vowel replaced by /-a/. Verb forms ending 
in /-i/ have a /-y-/ glide and those ending in /-u/ a /-w-/ glide before
